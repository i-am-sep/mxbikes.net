This track took roughly 3 months and 300+ hours to create.\u00a0Most of the time was spent on the environment models, baking shadow maps for all those objects, and the terrain masks using those shadow maps.\u00a0 The heightmaps were created entirely in Blender. I\u2019ve tried to make it as close to 1:1 scale as possible while still being rideable and fun in MXB.\u00a0 A lot of experimentation and testing was done to work around the MXB physics for the EX obstacles. This was mainly done with the use of two heightmaps.\nSpecial Thanks:\n\u2013 GreenLenux for custom wall art, logos, and bike model\n\u2013 iNsane for bike model and EDF conversion + information on FRM file format\n\u2013 Osmeralda for log base model\n\u2013 JV for water tank model\n\u2013 GioPanda for base fence model and trailer tires\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nREIX 2021\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 10853\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nREIX 2021.zip\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/pmy62qml2akgv4h/REIX_2021.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",
