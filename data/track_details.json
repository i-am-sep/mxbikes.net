        "description": "DescriptionDownloadsBring your jackets! We\u2019re racing the final round of the One-One MX series in Anchorage, Alaska. If you want to race this track on Monday, Nov. 11, 2024, find the One-One server or myself on Discord and we\u2019ll help get you signed up. We accept any level of rider, from beginner to pro, so don\u2019t be shy.This track is entirely conceptual, built to look like a race-ready track after a bit of snowfall. The majority of the terrain is dirt with some mud and snow in some areas around the track, along with some areas that are completely snow or starting to melt. I spent countless hours on getting the textures to look realistic and change as they\u2019re ridden on. The snow will look like its compacting down from the weight of the bike riding over it, while the dirt will start to look a little slick and muddy from the snow mixing with the dirt. Throw on some erode and it looks wonderful.This track isn\u2019t too difficult, but features ruts and bumps, a few big sends, along with some technical areas and multiple line choices in the corners. It\u2019s also been adapted and tested extensively to ride well with the new OEMS. Lastly, the snow has sand physics so it will pull the bike in and slow it down just as you\u2019d expect.There\u2019s been some recent reports from locals spotting Bigfoot and the Abominable Snowman in the area, so keep an eye out.Special thanks \u2013One-One SMX SeriesNewSkool for doing the race data/camera/marshals and helping me ideate and build some of the trackLynds, RedRider, Resolute Kraken, AGMX, Giopanda, Mouk Lab, Kellz, Cody James, PHANTOMZ, TFC, Navo, L0wpoly and anyone else I forgot for their awesome tutorials, assets, and whatever else got me this point.
