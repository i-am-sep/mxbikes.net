This track took roughly 3 months and 300+ hours to create. Most of the time was spent on the environment models, baking shadow maps for all those objects, and the terrain masks using those shadow maps.  The heightmaps were created entirely in Blender. I’ve tried to make it as close to 1:1 scale as possible while still being rideable and fun in MXB.  A lot of experimentation and testing was done to work around the MXB physics for the EX obstacles. This was mainly done with the use of two heightmaps.\nSpecial Thanks:\n– GreenLenux for custom wall art, logos, and bike model\n– iNsane for bike model and EDF conversion + information on FRM file format\n– Osmeralda for log base model\n– JV for water tank model\n– GioPanda for base fence model and trailer tires\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nREIX 2021\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 10853\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nREIX 2021.zip\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/pmy62qml2akgv4h/REIX_2021.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The owners let us pull out the Snowcats to build something fun for the community! Featuring many fun sections for very fast flowing racing, But once it gets rough it may get the best of you. With a couple pretty big doubles you may want to bump up or down a tooth in your gearing for the top end. Theres a handful of freeride hits leftover from the snowboard park on Hill 1. A small freestyle jump show course. And a bit of a historic freeride jump over a ski chair lift up top, so you can go for it like Jay Quinlan back in the day!\nThis track is my best yet, I spent a lot of time working on custom assets and perfecting my masking abilities. I really tried to really bring the track to life. Very proud of this project and what i have learning building it.\nThank You to my Supporters and the Earthwurx Crew for always holding it down when im asking any questions!\nFeatures 2 Tracks in the download for “Daytime” and “Night”.\nAlso included is the Server Versions.\n***Big Credits to these Asset Creators***\nKogan – Earthwurx Inflatable\nRedRider197 – Semi pack, SX Bales, Earthwurx Machines, Pit Swag\nSlabz – Marshalls, Restrooms\nAgitato – Archways, Holeshot, Banners\nThatfluffygecko – Crowds\nMulock22 – Pickup\nDylan44Frisch – Flagger Stands\nJanes46 -Nightkydome\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nPROCworks Snocross Rd.6\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1665\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nPROCworks Snocross Rd.6\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/i6cah62mrgl1d3k/PROCworks_SNOCROSS_RD.6.rar/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

That is why I am even happier to say that this is the result. Of course, things are always getting better and I will try to constantly improve myself. I hope that some people will like the track and of course people will recognize the potential of my tracks.\nI think the result is very good considering it is my second track. Of course, none of this would have been possible without tips and tricks from experienced track builders.\nBig thanks goes to\nKingMX818\n.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nWelcome to the 2024 SMX season finale, brought to you by the RedRum Track Crew. This is the last of the three rounds to end the 2024 championship. For those who have not participated in the SX or MX series, you can still race the finale on Dec 9 by joining the One-One SMX Discord and qualifying in through the LCQ. All levels of riders are welcome!\nThis last round is a fictional track based in Las Vegas. The track goes through the stadium and exits into the a Nevada desert environment  with a large mix of SX and MX areas throughout the track, including a split section for riders to decide between an MX or SX lane. The start is also split and extremely tight, so gate pick will be crucial.  It’s both technical and high speed, with multiple line choices in the the corners and rhythm lanes. The track is built for 250s, but flows great on 450s as well.\nSince this is the final round of 2024, we also added a straight rhythm in the parking lot.\nSpecial thanks:\nRedRider, Resolute Kraken, AGMX, Giopanda, Mouk Lab, Kellz, Cody James, PHANTOMZ, TFC, Navo, NKSTUF, JV, L0wpoly, VT Studios and anyone else I forgot for their awesome tutorials, assets, and whatever else got us to this point.\nTrack Info\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 2541\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nRecommended\nLasVegasSMX.pkz\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/aohxsyo1dewsv1g/LasVegasSMX.pkz/file\nOptional\nLasVegasSMX.pkz\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4SfKBzJNRtOfrMU5VewvZvWWGpGclva/view?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

While I’ve kept the general layout, I’ve tweaked the jump scaling and added a few new elements to make it ride better. The primary version of the track is unprepped and rough, built to reflect how the track would naturally form up over a long race day. You’ll need to get creative with your lines to put in a fast lap. For a different experience, I’ve also included a fully prepped version with a morning atmosphere, giving you the feeling of being the first rider on the track.\nThanks to:\nResolute Kraken for his tools\nGiopanda for the acerbis stakes\nThere’s quite a few links below, so make sure you download the right one.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nOutpost\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 9445\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nMega - Track PKZ\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/GlFCBIDS#qmblFsSfqxSIn-Jo2CeXctjoWqxVDxFWmpHKMPyakjs\nDefault\nMega - Track PKZ - PREPPED\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/2lcDlQgB#c3n8MXI8hA0JPAdtpODO7wGSP3Nl89WDAEEI4ZtYkxE\nDefault\nMega - Server PKZ\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/S18liCpI#Yxlo01yAOELzp0IXya-x-gYuBYK38rrP_gSlRYswsak\nDefault\nMega - Server PKZ - PREPPED\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/yoFFWYLC#9dPoRtPO5snbYQMpQV46HGsJQuTjVqz2VbxPcrO6BKM\nDefault\nGoogle Drive - Track PKZ\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1S1wQyZ_q-RhzV3rvqINpr24__Zfr4nFk/view?usp=sharing\nDefault\nGoogle Drive - Track PKZ - PREPPED\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1pyX6hryQIXQYveIBscRCl4-8pTrfl8wk/view?usp=sharing\nDefault\nGoogle Drive - Server PKZ\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-m6EnDJu1q0weR1zRJRw0IGdK6yubNDe/view?usp=sharing\nDefault\nGoogle Drive - Server PKZ - PREPPED\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_qpsEIMa1tV0IqWZ8YsV_srintm0hi2/view?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nI grew up in Temecula, and almost every weekend my dad and brother and I would ride from our house out through this canyon to Vail Lake dam. Most of the time it was a dried-out creek bed, which is how I recreated it here, but sometimes it turned into a rushing river with crazy water crossings. The canyon was filled with all kinds of stuff: rusty shot-up cars, figure-eight tracks, hill climbs, freeride jumps, and tons of fun trails.\nThis place holds a lot of great memories, so I thought it would be cool to make a track here. While it’s scaled down, the terrain itself stays true to the real location which is based off satellite data. I adjusted where the dam is slightly and scaled it up to make it more visible from the track. The creek bed has a sandy look and feel while the hills are made to look hard pack, but the track only uses soft soil for consistency. I added a sky for every weather condition, with the cloudy option being an orange sunrise. My apologies for the file size but I did my best to optimize it. A lot of the size comes from the amount of off-track objects to make the scenery look as realistic as possible.\nA huge thanks to Totes McGoats for testing and feedback. My current lap times are around 2:25, but there’s definitely room for improvement.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nTemecula Creek\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 6218\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nMega - Track PKZ\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/qksVlKIT#mcfe7XQtz3vZoAdVzwxLwAXyzBv3Gr76WIGBQtHoY60\nDefault\nMega - Server PKZ\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/nplVgITD#Dz56GnlhruS707f3m_ZGcnXLcAo_VyOZTjbkfp-Ooew\nDefault\nGoogle Drive - Track PKZ\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LTgjU-a-_Yavg6OABAV9cPG5X8mw9zqG/view?usp=sharing\nDefault\nGoogle Drive - Server PKZ\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1vovrirPwAOX2-MNTWb8f7AXMz7ao9-h6/view?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

However, with not enough time to complete the rounds, and other commitments, I’ve decided to release it as a stand-alone track. There may be some odd textures but it’s in a solid enough state to release. I hope you enjoy it!\nThe track itself features 40 pits/gates, cameras, and good timing gates. The start does feature ruts after the gates so choose your spot wisely! This should be a good track for racing with multiple lines and opportunities for mistakes.\nSpecial thanks to the following:\nRed Rider – for track objects and track making help.\nEarthWurx Discord – The entire community has been so welcoming and has helped greatly.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHi everyone! This is my very first mod.\nIt’s a replica of a track that unfortunately no longer exists today, the Virollet track in France, in its 1986 version.\nA little backstory: my dad competed in his first championships on this track in 1985 and 1986. It was a different time, as my dad didn’t have much in terms of gear—his setup was just a helmet, gloves, a t-shirt, and jeans. The 1986 season on the Virollet track was particularly memorable for him. Both my dad and his brother had serious crashes during that race. But that didn’t stop them ! In fact, that same year, at Saint Jean d’Angély (a track many will know), my dad finished 2nd.\nI wanted to recreate this track, which has since been replaced by a landfill in 2006, to give my dad the chance to relive the track he loved during his youth.\nThis track isn’t perfect. There are no archives except for some old photos I found in my parents’ attic, and my dad’s own memories to help me piece it together.\nThis is the first version, and I would love to get your feedback and advice on what can be improved.\nThe track is best suited for 125cc and 250cc, but on a 450cc, it starts getting tricky. Good luck—it’s a fairly technical track, and the last section of the course is quite challenging.\nThanks a lot to everyone who downloads it and provides constructive feedback.\nEnjoy !\n12-08-24 Update : Reupload of the image that had disappeared from the post.\nTrack Info\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4169\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nVirollet 1986\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/yh8o19mnhk8vzp2/Virollet_1986.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

This is the first of three rounds to end the 2024 championship. For those who have not participated in the SX or MX series, you can still race the SMX series on Dec 2 by joining the One-One SMX Discord and qualifying in through the LCQ. All levels of riders are welcome!\nThis first round is a fictional track based on the Keystone Raceway dragstrip in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The track features a full-length SX area within the dragway that transitions out to an MX section on the hillside behind the grandstands. It’s both technical and high speed, with multiple line choices in the the corners and rhythm lanes. The track is built for 250s, but flows great on 450s as well.\nSpecial thanks:\nRedRider, Resolute Kraken, AGMX, Giopanda, Mouk Lab, Kellz, Cody James, PHANTOMZ, TFC, Navo, NKSTUF, JV, L0wpoly, VT Studios and anyone else I forgot for their awesome tutorials, assets, and whatever else got us to this point.\nTrack Info\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1971\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nRecommended\nNormal Version\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/cwjvgpull0fjr5d/KeystoneRacewaySMX.pkz/file\nOptional\nNormal Version\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKGxzodEllr24u9sZo0TjwyS6HEiqIwV/view?usp=drive_link\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

This has been an ongoing project over the last couple of months enabling me to learn the process of track building for MX Bikes. There’s always more tweaks to be made, but i am happy where this is at right now and want to move onto my next track with the skills I’ve learnt building this one, so have decided to post this one up here.\nThe track is based on a real terrain map of UK countryside and have mixed in some raw UK style roughness as well as some big jumps to make it more fun. Hope you enjoy.\nAs this is my first upload, let me know if anything isn’t working.

This destruction derby figure-8-inspired track attempts to bring a Wreckfest-style, chaos-injected experience to\nMX Bikes\n. It’s not just about speed; it’s about surviving the insanity as riders throw down over a massive, gaping pit that is the mouth of a giant sandworm. Rows of razor-sharp teeth and flailing tentacles, ready to devour any unlucky rider who falls into its maw.\nCrossing jumps mean mid-air collisions are fair game. It’s every rider for themselves, with no guarantee of making it out alive.\nAuthor Notes:\nThanks for checking out my Track!!!! Since releasing ‘The Moon Hole’ I have started work on a fairly large project. While working on it, I had an idea for another track that I figured I could produce relatively easily and quickly. It would also allow me to learn and implement some new things that I would need for the big project. This is my 2nd track and it took me just over 2 weeks to produce. Just a short, simple track with some cool features.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nUPDATE: There was a hurricane, really bad one. Flying debris took out all the signs and most of the picnic tables. The green/wood skatepark and the tough blocks were lifted up by a tornado and scattered across the Bay. Thankfully, the dirt movers and the concrete skatepark survived and the whole process reduced the file size by close to half, the file size for the model is less than half of what it was. The signs were a large part of the file size I was trying to reduce and I couldn’t find a way to make them optimized, there were 44 of them and they were all 4k textures for readability so the tornado got them.\nAlso there’s a little flooding surrounding the track but it looks nice\nThis is based on the proposed track map for the real life 2025 Tampa Supercross.\nI tried to make it feel like a local park in the Tampa Bay area made a replica for the locals to practice on and give them a home field advantage.\nTesting was done on all bikes, so the new OEMs make all the jumps even on a 250\nSurrounding the track is a paved trail with freeride pavilions and 2 skateparks – one of those prebuilt wood parks you will find in any small town across America in various layouts, and a custom concrete bowl.\nFor the paved trail I suggest the A kit bikes because they have supermoto levels of grip on the asphalt surface.\nCloudy weather has a night skybox with a lot of stars to pretend like you’re sneaking in to get more laps in after the track is closed for the night. Enable “Flashlight” in Reshade to turn on the headlight.\nThere are corkboards with all of your favorite MXBikes video content creators along the paved trail. Contact me here if you would like to be included in this way on my next track, I tried to include as many video creators as possible but I know there are more than I was able to have the mental memory to include.\nThe track includes 2 different versions, a smooth version and a rough version.\nThank you to Resolute Kraken for the Track Builder program\nThank you Red Rider for the asset packs and texture brush pack\nThank you Cody and Kellz for the trees\nThank you Callum22 for the jump template\nThank you Panic Rev for the reshade tip for night-mode\nThank you King MX and everyone at Erect Erections for the support\nThank you Scrallex for fixing the norms on the Skidsteer\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@pepesilvia468/video/7434574554481167647\n@pepesilvia468\nnew skatepark vibes\n#mxbikes\n#freeride\n#fyp\n#bmx\n#bikelife\n#motocross\n#skatepark\n♬ original sound – PEPE SILVIA MX BIKES\nUpdate 11/9/24:\nadded rough version\nfixed concrete texture on the skatepark\nadjusted holeshot tipple to be more realistic to what they will probably make IRL\non/off table section adjusted a little\nslight fixes to skybox\nUpdate 1/4/25:\nreduced file size\nadded pond\nadded norms to objects\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nTampa 2025\nAuthor time:\n00:59.420\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 6166\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nmega - track - rough and rutted\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/kqt21KyZ#HD3JYf7xM5uEGBbV0e7d2OsQTqPg5a6ckAs3KhbTuVI\nDefault\nmega - track - smooth\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/YncmALQC#Enkz6m19K5rLOd-1JSb63V-zax0Br8rHpUpoHI2_OBw\nDefault\nMega - Server -  Both versions\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/tyM3gKqa#SC56Aiq5logUPnc817q-Ku4Fhqv0PVnLMmCA2dLXZbU\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nBring your jackets! We’re racing the final round of the One-One MX series in Anchorage, Alaska. If you want to race this track on Monday, Nov. 11, 2024, find the One-One server or myself on Discord and we’ll help get you signed up. We accept any level of rider, from beginner to pro, so don’t be shy.\nThis track is entirely conceptual, built to look like a race-ready track after a bit of snowfall. The majority of the terrain is dirt with some mud and snow in some areas around the track, along with some areas that are completely snow or starting to melt. I spent countless hours on getting the textures to look realistic and change as they’re ridden on. The snow will look like its compacting down from the weight of the bike riding over it, while the dirt will start to look a little slick and muddy from the snow mixing with the dirt. Throw on some erode and it looks wonderful.\nThis track isn’t too difficult, but features ruts and bumps, a few big sends, along with some technical areas and multiple line choices in the corners. It’s also been adapted and tested extensively to ride well with the new OEMS. Lastly, the snow has sand physics so it will pull the bike in and slow it down just as you’d expect.\nThere’s been some recent reports from locals spotting Bigfoot and the Abominable Snowman in the area, so keep an eye out.\nSpecial thanks –\nOne-One SMX Series\nNewSkool for doing the race data/camera/marshals and helping me ideate and build some of the track\nLynds, RedRider, Resolute Kraken, AGMX, Giopanda, Mouk Lab, Kellz, Cody James, PHANTOMZ, TFC, Navo, L0wpoly and anyone else I forgot for their awesome tutorials, assets, and whatever else got me this point.

I was asked to make this track by E-Dawg69 and D1rty202, so thanks to them for the idea! With over 400 hours of work into this map, I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\nI have never rode in California, so it’s bit harder for me to get the “feel” you all get when riding there. The look of the tracks are Prepped and Watered, with deform from a short amount of riding.\nThe Main track has Gates and Lap timing, but the Vet track does\nNOT.\nOne section of the Vet Track is fun, but unpractical so that’s why I did not add lap times. The ‘Rookie White’ Section is either a\ntriple\nor\nquad\n, and doubling feels too small for MX Bikes. It was hard for me to make it proper especially with new Bikes coming soon..\n40 Pits\n24 Gates\nSpecial Thanks:\nIDEA & TESTING:\nD1rty202, Edawg69, DAMO, Just Goon It, The Den\nOBJECTS:\nParamoto910 – Water Tanks & Vehicles\nTRACK TOOLS & TIPS:\nResolute Kraken, TFC, EarthWurx\nIf you would like to Donate, There is a link down below to my PayPal.

What more could you want?\nBojangles Chicken Supreme MX is my 6th published track, and I’m more proud of this track than any of my prior builds. It is a track for all skill levels but has some huge/fast lines for the pros. I spent far more time on the heightmap, texturing, and overall planning for this track and I believe I’ve produced something everyone can have fun on. It is a large file size, I will work on optimization on my next track.

With over 6,500m of interconnected trails built to be ridden in either direction, these mountains are easy to get lost in. After my first track awhile back, I wanted to try my hand at something larger scale.\nIn the spawn area you’ll find a trails map, with the (timed) outer loop being highlighted in blue. While it can be ridden both directions, timing goes southward from the finish line (starting in the 4 way intersection, head towards the finish). Additionally there are blue signs that indicate that you are on the outer loop, and if they are on your right side, you are heading in the right direction for timing. I’ve also added additional indication signs for blind corners, intersections, and the path to take to stay on the outer loop when the trail splits.\nYou’ll also notice 2 different skies in the screenshots. The blue sky is on clear/rainy conditions, and the northern lights are on the cloudy conditions. Overall the trails are relatively easy, I was aiming for a relaxing hold RT experience. There is some roughness in some areas though, so pushing for time isn’t incredibly easy.\nMassive thanks to Red, not only for assets, but also for tips and suggestions for creating my own assets, as well as playtesting!\nEnjoy!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nAlpineTrails\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 5336\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nPKZ - Mega\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/dNAAUIYY#QUSrFOMnJ_4OCxprNjrwpFAdbPxtGt5BQLAoVc52jw0\nDefault\nPKZ - Mediafire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/egg0zqw9babasvj/AlpineTrails.pkz/file\nOptional\nServer - Mega\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/wAx2UJCD#lnSJDHLLqGlCAmyZodE2rTgSlfQoEjlb0qtIoOUBWWo\nOptional\nServer - Mediafire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/cgbp5tx3ebq9bpo/AlpineTrails_-_Server.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nWELCOME TO\nTHE MOON HOLE\nby J-PRING\nYes, that’s right! We are going to the MOON!\nHere at SPACE MX we like to go big or go even bigger, and that’s why we need you! A test subjec *coughing*…a “Thrill Seeker!”  Destined to push the limits of what is possible! The track is located inside a 400m wide crater with features designed to test your skills and our new line of astronaut diapers (we expect you’ll “go big”). The locals have no understanding of what makes a good MX track but their services proved invaluable for the construction. This was their first go at it so you might see a few things that aren’t quite up to our standards here on earth.\nRace Starts as soon as we land, watch your step, it’s a 130ft drop to the surface!\nThis track includes a 20-30 min enduro track that weaves its way around the crater. It starts (Green) near the center of the crater, simply follow the colored markers along the paths, changing colors as you pass different “Follow” signs indicating which color you need to follow next until you are back to the start.\nTHE TOWER CHALLENGE!!!\nGOAL\n: Reach the top!\nRULES\n:\nEasy Mode\n– You can set track markers only on the red platforms and you can only walk backwards on the obstacles.\nImpossible Mode\n– No resets, can only walk backwards on obstacles.\nAuthor Notes:\nHello wonderful people! Thank you for checking out my track! This is a pretty massive accomplishment for myself 🙂 it is my first track and my first time making something for a videogame. After working on this track off and on for over 2 years, learning how everything works and a lot about how things don’t work 😛 I am proud to present to you my creation!!!\nWhen I started this project with about 40 hours of playtime in MX bikes, I sucked at the game and hardly knew anything about track construction or how to make a good MX track. My first intention was to make an Enduro MX hybrid, a track that would push my skills at the time and make me better at the game. I’m now at 280 hours in game from almost exclusively testing this track (and having a blast doing it) and as my skills in the game got better so did my track building. I have learned a lot about what goes into making these tracks and there’s definitely a lot I would change but given that I’ve been working on this track for so long, I need to just get it out into the public and start working on the next track 😀\nI made all my own assets for the track. The only things I didn’t make are the Company and Manufacturer Logos on the signs. I knew I wanted to have a crazy start to the track, something people haven’t seen before. My first thought was to have a dropship in the sky that the riders jump out of. I didn’t even know if this would be possible but after some testing I knew I could do it. I’m a fan of rockets and after seeing the development of Starship by SpaceX and their crazy tower catching concept, I had to make something inspired by it.\nOverall I’m very happy with how everything turned out, it’s not perfect but I will just have to accept that 😛\nAs this is my first track I’m releasing it FOR FREE!!!! I want everyone to be able to enjoy this track and If you did enjoy it, please consider donating so I can buy sandwiches and make more tracks <3\nDonation Link\nADMIN UPDATE 9/30:\nThere are now 2 versions of the track with different names, so you\nmust\nhave these new ones in order to race them online now!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nMoonHole\nAuthor time:\n03:22.222\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoil\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4105\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nThe Moon Hole - v1 - Soil\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16KsVJP4nZvjfMtErDKKQFJZuj0zJPjlK?usp=drive_link\nDefault\nThe Moon Hole - v1 - Soil - Server Files\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IK87VlYvoFOcT1fQHI6wXCHdRthkQzfw?usp=drive_link\nDefault\nThe Moon Hole - v1 - Soft Soil\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17deAsShPlAaZAja5kG1I7iFNOy4K9Nh1?usp=drive_link\nDefault\nThe Moon Hole - v1 - Soft Soil - Server Files\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ooBPZqVtrRAh2WeR6STUMqA7oXXix-22?usp=drive_link\nDefault\nTrack Download v0 (old version)\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1tCZ_eiCfNtj5iYaGyhY7dy4v8dgt6BrY/view?usp=drive_link\nDefault\nServer Files v0 (old version)\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1mN_IMjuPDqDfMbxuPmyyfsJlr02QQo0Z/view?usp=drive_link\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\nJ-PRING!\nThank you very much, fellow earthling!\nDonate Button :D",

However, this will be the first official track release from the RedRum Track Crew, a combined effort of me (NewSkool) and Dr.PhDeez! Now, I started this track way back in March as a solo project of creating a One-One Compound. It has gone through several massive overhauls over the last few months, especially once Deez joined me.\nThis map features two tracks. The main MX track that is going to be round 5 of the One-One MX Series. Lap times sit around the 2 minute mark. There are 40 pits and 40 gates, so hosting a full lobby is possible! I also set up custom cameras, which makes streaming races and making edits extremely fun! There are multiple line selections throughout the track, making for some excellent racing and great passing opportunities. This track was designed for the 250, however I did do some testing on 125s and 450s. For those with experience on the 125, you can hit just about anything if you keep your speed up. The 450s are a tad overkill, but with proper throttle control and ability to scrub can be really fun as well!\nThe second track is an SX track. This track does not have any gates and is meant for practice on 125s and 250s. For those of you who rode round 9 of the One-One SX series, you will see a heavy resemblance. That is because we decided to take this track, scale it up properly for a SX race and adjusted it to be better for full racing. It is a solid track that helps for practicing your ability to be exact with your jumps and throttle control in the corners. It is also a heck of a lot of fun to do some 1v1 races with friends.\nA massive shoutout to\nRedRider for all his help and awesome assets\nKellz x Cody for the Tree Pack\nAgitato for multiple assets\nPhantomz for the skidsteer asset\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nOne.One.Designs.Compound\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSand\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4956\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nOne.One.Designs.Compound\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/ldsig3xr23p52uf/One.One.Designs.Compound.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Glad its finally released I try to get everyone on the tough blocks, if I missed your I’ll get you next round. If for some reason Track Pkz doesn’t work just download the WinRAR folder and drop into Supercross tracks folder. Any other issues please let me know and ill fix asap. Thanks, and I hope you enjoy.\nCredits:\nRed Rider – Tuff Blocks\nResolute – Program\nNiko – Technical help\nMouk Labs – TrackEd help\nRoshell- Gates\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nSteezy Mx - Las Vegas SMX 2024.Pkz\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSand\nSoft Soil\nSoil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 3966\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nRecommended\nMega.nz Las Vegas SMX Track Rider Pkz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/8PVVUaaD#7alKptkf8OAivopLUal7yGGPcmRwXsFHF9XtQWHYulY\nRecommended\nMediafire Las Vegas SMX Track Rider Pkz\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/ev7ts4i64ajiti0/Steezy_Mx_-_Las_Vegas_SMX_2024.pkz/file\nServer Version\nMega.nz Las Vegas SMX Server Pkz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/VGsSGaoQ#eW06aMt9fC5jPjTrxuPl3nvQ6_dGMZxdYI_1SS7OLBg\nServer Version\nMediafire Las Vegas SMX Server Pkz\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/efllcm0x27kmafv/Steezy_Mx_-_Las_Vegas_SMX_2024.pkz/file\nOptional\nMega.nz WinRar Las Vegas SMX\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/9OlnGLqb#tj5O32Yt3ck6dXA1fgEJBo1PM_JW2YAexiPjUEwjIcA\nOptional\nMediafire WinRar Las Vegas SMX\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/mxunfaryl3uhwon/Steezy_Mx_-_Las_Vegas_SMX_2024.rar/file\nMod Instructions\nRun Track Deformation at .50 or lower for best results\nSupport\nSteezy Mx!\nYou can also donate to my cash app if you'd like @ $Corbin580\nBuy me lunch!",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nInstructions\nSet Track Deformation to .50 or lower for best results.\nWelcome to Version 2 (V2) Dallas/ Ft Worth Tx, Rd.2 of the 2024 SMX Playoffs by Steezy Studios. Regular gates this time, I was able to fit 28 which means I left the scaling exactly the same as version 1. I did this because it created an easier workflow in order to stay on track for Las Vegas.\nWith this version of Dallas Texas SMX Rd.2 I used the original layout that was first released to public. I also combined some features from the alternate map that they used Irl. The reason I combined both maps is because they both have great features, and I feel like this is what the Texas SMX track should have been.\nThese tracks are built in less than a week, but I still do my best to deliver a decent track and a preview of what to expect. Again, track scaling is larger than IRL but not by much. Unfortunately, I had already placed my track objects/ Curves before realizing I was slightly over scaled, and it can be a real pain fixing objects afterwards.\nIf for some reason the Track/ Rider Pkz doesn’t work, then use the WinRAR folder and it should work then. Not sure why it’s doing this. You can also use the Skyboxes and any other info you need in the WinRAR file. Other than that, I believe I’ve worked all the bugs out but if there are any issues, please let me know and I’ll be sure to fix asap. Thanks, and I hope you enjoy this newer version of the track.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nSteezy Mx - Texas SMX 2024 V2 pkz\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSand\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4743\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nRecommended\nMega.nz Texas SMX 2024 Version 2 Track/Rider\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/oDlD0agZ#sQuiRVbbiCPE8cBKc4MFNM_kxB7mSia07ynBaid6Z4k\nRecommended\nMediafire Texas SMX 2024 Version 2 Track/Rider\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/ep3nh6sm7uwx78n/Steezy_Mx_-_Texas_SMX_2024_V2.pkz/file\nServer Version\nMega.nz Texas SMX 2024 Version 2 Server\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/9SlC1b4R#hmB2zpDYXVIJLZwFIy9-h8A8tr9kTFVz5H7-k9TWo3g\nServer Version\nMediafire Texas SMX 2024 Version 2 Server\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/4m7cmah8ymtq71g/Steezy_Mx_-_Texas_SMX_2024_V2.pkz/file\nOptional\nMega.nz Texas SMX 2024 Version 2 WinRAR\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/AOEHAaoB#c6vYAdgqmxgrs0XahgSlrqPlA6fxLpKeXauxJYA97D0\nOptional\nMediafire Texas SMX 2024 Version 2 WinRAR\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/jwzgh7cfwo5rui7/Steezy_Mx_-_Texas_SMX_2024_V2.rar/file\nMod Instructions\nSet Track Deformation to .50 or lower for best results\nSupport\nSteezy Mx!\nYou can also donate to my cash app if you'd like @ $Corbin580\nBuy me lunch!",

There’s a few things I’d do differently, and a lot of things I’ve learned that I will be putting to use in future releases. I tried to go for a vibrant, colorful woods track that was somewhere in-between beginner and intermediate, in addition to having different viable lines. My best time is around 01:11, but I’m still fairly new to the game and I’m sure there’s plenty of room for improvement.

This Track was made as a test of both a template and texturing/masking test for a supercross series. the scaling is on the smaller side so those who prefer smaller cc bikes or are newer to the game will hopefully find it very good for sx prep. 450s are also great fun throughout. They were also tested on the preview bikes so make sure to give them a go (why there is no ruts) so you can slide around corners well). There is also an FMX Line featuring a working loop de loop but its extremely difficult\nThe track itself is beginner level and fairly easy to ride and spin laps on !\nSpecial thanks to\nRedrider -objects\nPhantomz- objects\nFluffy geko – objects\nAjito – objects\nMouse – Help and questions answered\nENJOY !\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nFeatherline SX.pkz\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4742\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nMEGA - PLAYER\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/oHcH2CxT#whs4ydFx4k5WMPUhVCsbDZE_rAFHsSgDqSDDYnxAC88\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\neagle!\nDonations are in no way expected but they help greatly towards paying for things like track models and servers for a future custom track race series.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nUpdate! Thank you for all of your feedback. I kept the crowd noise but it is now much, much lower, more of an ambient background noise now to still give the track some life. Shouldn’t be able to hear it over the bike noises unless you really listen for it. Server file will be updated as well! Please redownload.\nJoin the One-One SMX crew on Monday, Sept. 2, 2024 for the first round of our 2024 250 MX series at\nOrchard Farms MX\n, based in Eldridge California! If you want race this track, find the One-One server or myself on Discord and we’ll help get you signed up. We accept any level of rider, from beginner to pro, so don’t be shy!\nThis is my very\nfirst track release\nand I’m excited to share it with you all. This track is a remake of one of the first conceptual tracks I built in MXGP2020,\nfeatured by windam151\n. It only made sense to bring it to MX Bikes.\nI put a lot of time and effort into building this track to have great visuals, fun elevation changes, multiple lines, ruts in the jump faces and corners, along with actual physical texture in the terrain. The addition of the physical texture is minimal, but seems to help with traction and makes the track feel a bit more realistic. Overall, it’s a great track for intermediate riders, and allows some flexibility for newer riders to learn on without being too difficult. This track is built for a 250, but is a lot of fun on a 350/450 as well.\nThis track will also be available on the server list, so feel free to run it!\nSpecial thanks –\nOne-One SMX crew for letting me practice texturing in the SX series leading to creating R1 for the MX series\nNewSkool for helping me learn the ins and outs of track building\nLynds, RedRider, Resolute Kraken, AGMX, Giopanda, Mouk Lab, Kellz, Cody James, PHANTOMZ, TFC, Navo, L0wpoly and anyone else I forgot for their awesome tutorials, assets, and whatever else got me this point.

I would recommend a 450 but any other bike is rideable for this track. I’ve spent months working on this in between school and riding, I think it came out good. All these jumps are made by “hand”. Meaning I didn’t use a template .The SX track is made to be hard and technical (INTENSE). The Whip track is made for throwing whips. The outer track is made for 2 people to “race” it. There’s different little lines through out the map. I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed building this track! Working on another track but this one will be really easy.\nThanks to lynds for the tutorial video, Red rider for some models.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nINTENSE SUPERCROSS\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 769\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nHigh Quality\nMediafire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/folder/9d9lr4eoiungd/INTENSE+SUPERCROSS\nHigh Quality\nMega\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/folder/7yAUmLCY#UZC54syvmjieLAoBFZedMA\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nWelcome to the 10th and final round of the One-One SMX 250 SX Championship! With this race we wrap up what has been an extremely fun supercross series and get ready for our outdoors portion of our SMX Championship! If you love supercross and would like to join, find me on discord and I will help get you signed up for mondays race!\nBefore we get to the track, I just want to thank everyone who has played these tracks over the last few months. It has been a really tough process trying to make tracks that are different and fun for everyone. While some of the tracks may have had issues, I really appreciate you guys for giving them a shot. There is no better feeling as a creator than people enjoying the tracks we release.\nJust like before, the awesome textures all come from DR.PhDeez! He has been absolutely crucial in these last few rounds looking so much better!\nNow for what you are all here for, a run down of the track and a few pictures to show off what we have for you!\nThe first feature you can see is the awesome split start outside of the stadium. Half the field will go right and the other half will go left. They then come back together inside the stadium for a long rhythm up the middle.\nThe second feature is a split rhythm section. Going into the corner you have to set up for which lane you want. They are pretty even timing wise, so its all about how fast you can hit them!\nThe third feature is specific for the race this monday. We will be using a joker lane for this race! Now, there isn’t a specifically built joker lane. For this race, one time during each moto, the rider must take a left after the over under jump and circle around the start straight and merge back how they would have on the start. It adds about 13-14 seconds to the lap. This is not required if playing on your own or in your own server, this is specific to the One-One series race!\nThe last feature for this track has nothing to do with racing! To make this a tad more special we have added an extra feature to the track. I know a lot of people will scoff at the file size, which I can understand. However, that was necessary in order for me to add this. Outside of the stadium by the pits, the first thing you will see when you spawn is a full length straight rhythm! Not to mention several fmx jumps headed the other direction so you can throw some nasty tricks while headed back to the start!\nMassive shoutout to RedRider for all his advice and assets! This community would be so empty without him here.\nMassive shoutout again to Dr.PhDeez for all his help!\nShout out to NKSTUF for the curved flag assets!\nShout out to theFluffygecko for his FMX assets!\nLastly, another massive thanks from the RedRum Track Crew to you guys! Thank you all for playing and enjoying these tracks. We have some more projects in the works for the rest of the year! Not to mention the stuff being planned out already for next year!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nRD10.LasVegas\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 2131\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nRD10.LasVegas\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/jiuanmn556pflpu/RD10.LasVegas.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

This track is my first full SX track I’ve ever built. Now is when you say, “Didn’t you make the SX prep tracks in 2023?” Yes, but those weren’t meant to be raced on, more track map preview’s.\nAlright, so obviously this is inspired by a certain NES game. I wanted the obstacles to be as close as possible to the game but also compatible with MxBikes. This track was tested primarily with the 450 which I recommend. It is ridable with a 250, but the big lines aren’t possible.\nOBSTACLES:\nThe jumps are oversized, peaky, and also feature flat tops to mimic the game. I also put some lips on the tables to make them on/offs. I did try doing the orangish color with white faces and green backsides but it looked too strange texture wise.\nTrack Features:\nPixelized most of the decals, objects to try to give it a retro theme. The bales DO NOT have collisions, but if you cut through them you will get cuts so watch the boundaries. 20 gates, 20 pits, fully working camera’s. Skybox is styled after a retro game. Grass is also meant to mimic the game.\nSOIL:\nI made the decision to keep the soil type as SOIL. This is done to make the track technical, and keep riders honest with the obvious big lines caused by the large obstacles of the track. So, this means when you fall (which you will eventually) it will take some finesse to get going.\nWant to help support?\nRace in the Red Stars Racing Series on MyMXB starting August 17th! These will be featuring my recent MNSR Series of tracks which you can find on\nthe Mx Bikes Shop.\nTHANK YOU TO:\nRed Rider – For all the help you’ve given me, the objects, and testing over the years.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nI am of the possibly unpopular opinion that MX vs. ATV Alive was an easy top 3 in the series, and have a lot of great memories from playing it. Quarry basin was easily one of my favorite tracks in the game and I can’t quite put my finger on why, but when I decided I wanted to give track building a go, I figured, why not try and do a replica of a track I spent hours on in the past.\nI entered the process thinking it would be somewhat straight forward, as I didn’t have to replicate much in the terms of roughness or ruts, but quickly realized I was in for a struggle. After my first attempt at a heightmap, I realized I would not be able to scale the track anywhere close to the original map in order for it to ride the same in bikes. Many features of what I have created vary significantly from the original game, hence the title of the track being Quarry basin (Ish). The overall layout is similar to the original Quarry basin, but the jumps, scaling and even the corners have been altered a ton. A prime example being the hip jump, which originally pulled almost a 180.\nI think the track has many aspects that could be improved on, but I think it is in a state which is very fun to ride, with different lines, which are close in times through each section. My approach to the track was to test and scale it so that a 250 could make every jump, but had to stretch many of the jumps. I am of the opinion that it is pretty beginner friendly, but an intermediate rider can practice their timings in order to really optimize their lap times.\nI want to give a massive thank you to KingMX818 for showing me many tips and tricks within the entire process and being patient despite my endless questions.\nAlso, thank you to the boys (you know who you are), the whole SHG team and others who helped give their thoughts, test ride and help me with understanding the track building process.\nCredits:\nBuilding and water tower models: Navo009\nFlagger stands and track markers: KingMX818\nBoulders: Slabz\nPit fences and Redbul tents: Giopanda\nBales\n,\nsemis\n,\npit tents\n,\nwater\nand\nwater trucks\n; RedRider.\nStart/Finish banner\n: RossHell\nStart Banner\n: Agitato\nSkid Steer\n: Im_Phantomz\nTrees\n: KeLLz & Cody\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nQuarry Basin\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 7695\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nRecommended\nMedia Fire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/01u4wet20w09ccc/Quarry_Basin.pkz/file\nServer Version\nServer Version\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/kfw8m9333lv9229/Server_version.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

It’s a really fun and flowing track to ride IRL and so I thought I’d try and bring that to the game. Its scaling isn’t 1-1 and I’ve done some tweaks here and there. Big thanks to my two mates Rio and Dafys for trying and looking over a few different ideas i had for the track. Need to give a massive shout out to @Lynds for his track building tutorial series. Made the process much easier and was simple to follow. I decided to decorate the track with a little bit of everything to get used to using Blender.

It’s a intermediate track with one section being a pro section along with challenging whoops. Tested on 450 mainly as that is all I ride.

It’s a full sand track and overall it’s pretty rough and challenging. I like using higher fidelity foliage but because of the amount I needed I created low poly assets for it so hopefully the frame rates are fine. I spent time making sure all 3 environments (sunny, cloudy, rainy) look good and I usually prefer riding it when it’s cloudy. I’ve started learning some new tools and techniques and personally I think this is my best work to date but you guys can be the judges. As usual I tested this mostly on the 450 and the 250 will really need to be stretched on some of the jumps. My best time is about a 2:34 but I’m sure there’s a ton of room for improvement.\nThanks to:\nResolute Kraken because I probably wouldn’t be building tracks if it wasn’t for his tools\nTotes McGoats for testing and lots of back and forth on improving our techniques\nNuggetBoi for being very gracious with his time helping me test\nI don’t plan to try and release paid tracks in the future because I really enjoy the process.

You’ll find a few of these hauled into the hills across the map.\nOut in the hills, you’ll find alot of shovel hits, there are so many freeride lines to come up with.\nThe trail loop isn’t very long, or much too special. But it will take you to or near almost every riding spot throughout the map.\nTo complete a lap time you will need to go through the parking lot. I didn’t focus at all on racing here so I never bothered to fix it.\nNot all the jumps hit like butter. Some you may have to work for, gas out or hit with a more calculated approach,\nTo find that sweet spot of a landing.\nParamoto910 swung by to check out this F14 Tomcat tail we found. He then of coarse shoveled  a hit over it! Then proceeded to leave his Red Rev behind, after getting it stuck. Legend says its still out there.\n(Credits to Paramoto910 for the F14 Tail model)\nThere are some tricky big steppers that’s for sure.\nI could have done more to this map but decided to focus on my next Track instead, this was mainly used for a test facility for the “Snocross Mod” Physics, and as practice for building realistic feeling locations.\nI Hope you enjoyed the map, i love hearing the feedback and content. Also the slight teaser within the photo’s of our new upcoming Snocross chassis. The\nREV-DOO 600RS COMING SOON!\nDrag .pkz into motocross folder.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nWelcome to the first contribution of the “Geringverdiener ([\nɡəˈʁɪŋfɛɐ̯ˌdiːnɐ\n]\nGeringverdiener\n) Racing Association”.\nThis is obviously just fun. But we also had a funny evening where we decided to host a little 12 man Straight Rhythm event. Sadly the current Straight Rhythm implementation isn’t the best for that case so here I am with a dirty fix.\nThe track is called “Straight Rhythm GRA” in game, so you can use it parallel to the already existing stock track.\nThe centerline is untouched, only thing I changed to make it a better experience was:\nRemoved the straight_rhythm value, so it’s possible to practice during an online session, and for all the other things to work\nMoved start/finish right after the drop-off, so the lap starts counting once you left the podium\nSplit 1 is untouched and Split 2 is now the new “finish” – this is mandatory for qualifying laps (more later on)\nAdded some layout objects to make it the real deal, to prevent collisions in pits ect. and to display the “rules” I came up with in less than 3 minutes\nHow to play it:\nOn the track there’s multiple “rule books”. Read and obey them!\nBest experience is to be in a voice chat with all contestants, someone has to moderate it, be admin in the server and work out a Google or Excel sheet, for example:\nThe server MUST have collisions disabled! This is mandatory, otherwise the game or server will crash. Reason below.\nThe contestants should either do their qualifying laps (decide for a time, start a new practice or actual qualifying session, then everyone has 3 tries) or you go by list and do it manually\nFor a qualifying lap to count, the contestant has to start a lap, ride the track, return, and jump off/start a new lap to finish the previous one and write data to the session. That way the host/moderator can see the S2 time and transfer that over to the sheet.\nSo S2 time = time from drop off to finish arch\nOnce the qualifying is done, the host/moderator has to prepare the groups.\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT!!\nOnce the groups are set, the riders have to pick their gates according their position in the groups. So say Group 1, Player 1 picks gate 1. Player 2 picks gate 2. Group 4, Player 1 has to pick gate 7!\nThat way you make sure that the contestants are on the opposite line. This has to be repeated for each advanced round.\nIf everyone picked their gate, the host/moderator starts the race session.\nONLY\nthe currently active group is allowed to race!\nEVERYONE\nelse has to go to replay and watch that race! This is real fun, especially stressing for the current riders as everyone is looking at them. The track has an awesome auto-cam and also a side drone, which looks really cool aswell.\nAfter a race:\nHost/moderator writes down who won, and then either the group that finished right now continues with the next match, or the next group starts so it’s not too boring for everyone. This is up to you.\nMake sure everyone has their gates, then start a practice session and once that’s loaded start the race session. Again, only the currently active group is allowed to race, everyone else go grab that camera.\nFirst who won 2 matches in a group advances to next round. Then there’s 1/4 finale, 1/2 finale, finale… or whatever you’re up to.\nKnown bugs:\nThe added objects should be collidable, for some reason they’re not like they’ve been back then. I will probably update the track once PiBoSo explained to me how or if it should work, we’ll see.\nSometimes the gates get messed up. The track comes with 20 gates (10 left, 10 right), so if someone isn’t able to get the picked gate, try some that are not used by other players.\nWait, 20 gates, 10 left, 10 right. Wdym bro?\nIn order to fully work, there’s 10 gates overlapping each other so those who are in the active group are definitely able to race. I can’t  explain it really, but this is how I figured it out. So make sure opponents are definitely on the opposite of each others, so one has the left gate and the other has the right gate.\nI hope you kinda got my idea and I explained it ok enough for anyone to understand. If not, we are probably going to stream an evening and show exactly how we have thought it through. Sounds confusing at first but it’s definitely only the first time that it’s confusing.\nWish you good battles and let’s hope to make Straight Rhythm great again!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nstraight_rhythm_gra\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 3552\nDefault\n1drv.ms\nDownload from 1drv.ms\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!AmFynRoK33UNhO1VWoQ6kTkC74PDSQ?e=k8KBNc\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\ninsane!\nAny support is greatly appreciated! ♥\nBuy me a beer!",

The textures are amazing and add a level of detail I could never achieve. So a huge thanks to him for this!\nThis track is very flowy and has some easier to hit rhythms as well as some big boy lines. I can see lap times getting down into the 55s and 56s for those at higher skill levels. Do be careful in the whoops, the textures aren’t just a visual addition. They are physical so if you go into the whoops sideways you might find yourself in trouble!\nHuge shoutout to RedRider as always. His advice and assets are what make this possible for me!\nBig shoutout to Agitato for his holeshot sign.\nThanks to PHANTOMZ for his skid steer asset\nAlso a shoutout to JANES46 for the skydome\nLastly, if you run into any problems please let me know!

This time we bring you a major mix-up with addition of a mudder! So if that sounds interesting, find me on discord and I’ll help get you signed up! We don’t care what your skill level is, come join us for some fun gate drops! Racing starts at 9pm central on Monday nights!\nDue to the weather, the track was cut down just like they tend to do in IRL in order to make the track actually ridable. That being said, qualifying made the track quite rutted already, so there is a level of difficulty added simply by that. Racing should be tight and fun, just keep that back wheel planted so you don’t go down!\nFor those of you racing this on your own, make sure to turn the rain on in order to really get a feel for what this track was designed for!\nThis track idea for the mud would not have been possible without the skills of DR.PHDEEZ who handled all of the textures and masks! I have to say it looks phenomenal in game and really looks extremely muddy! So a big thanks for all his help!\nLastly, a huge shoutout to RedRider for all his awesome track assets. Also a big thanks to thefluffygecko for the fmx ramps!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nRD8.Arlington\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nSoil\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 635\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nDefault\nRD8.Arlington\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/mi40ksmm1y0rlgq/RD8.Arlington.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

You might remember the epic gopro videos of it on youtube from about 10 years ago. Its a very gnarly small overgrown track with muddy ruts, puddles of water, lots of elevation changes. It is raceable, there are 24 gates which will be extremely hectic and hopefully a lot of fun. For the first lap only you must go straight – do not take the first right turn, every lap after take the right turn with the large single rut immediately after passing the start straight.\nit works best on 250cc bikes.\nBeing one of my tracks there are also a number of freeride jumps located around the map.\nFor this release I improved my fake ruts, learned how to add water and water reflections.\nRain weather is a cool vibe on this track give it a shot.\nIt is free but donations are appreciated greatly\nI hope you enjoy –\nCredits – Kellz and cody tree pack, Agitato banners, skybox from  Openfootage . net\nTrack Info\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 8977\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nRecommended\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1RWcxLKdD-00ftcUTZpitb16MvrtdOioY/view?usp=sharing\nRecommended\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/dTN1CDBL#eJ0gPhjdFhY2EXl4fe8UL0SxsM3Mu74Qr7x80oePb1w\nServer Version\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lJCYEVGcJ4ut9BwSztaVeEzg7C4JVqEI?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\nSteezy93!\nAny donations are greatly appreciated!\nBuy me a Drink",

I wanted something challenging in MXB, something as accurate to IRL as I could muster, and something new to push myself (boy did I find that). So I got to thinking, and remembered this aggravating course from one of the MXGP games. The hills, the patience to go fast, the risk of crashing off a mountain, but in MXB. This project has been through a lot of changes, with me joining both the ARL and OEM teams and having my full focus split between however many projects both in game and IRL.\nThis is based on the 2015 MX des Nations, moto 2 videos. It’s tight, it’s technical, the berms/ruts hook and vanish. You won’t have a good time if you just try to pin it 5th WFO everywhere. There’s steep hills, with turns, and ruts, and roughness.

This time around we find ourselves in Iowa City for what is sure to be an exciting race! We found ourselves a new winner in round 5, so the points are getting tighter!\nIf joining the series sounds fun, find me on discord (NewSkool) and I will get you into the discord so you can join! We don’t care what your skill level is. Come and join us for some exciting gate drops!\nFor round 6, I backed away from a lot of the different features that I’ve used in prior rounds. Though I did sort of snag an idea from Reflex for those that might remember. While the track isn’t extremely difficult, some sections can be tricky and require some throttle control. There are a couple of different line choices that are viable and even some big lines if you can pull them off that can save a ton of time.\nI hope you enjoy the track, and as always I love feedback. I know I’m not the best creator around but I feel like I grow with each track I release. Feedback really helps me grow and fix issues as I move forward.\nAs always, massive shoutout to RedRider for all the awesome track objects and all his advice and tips!

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHello, I’m NuggetBoi and I proudly present you Kleinhau! It’s another replica of an iconic german track in my region. The Nighttimecross Race held here is one of the biggest Oldtimer Events in Europe. I personally hate riding here (cause lack of Skill) so i thought, i should share my pain with this community 😀\nThe track has 40 Gates. As you can see by the Map, the start has a different line than the usual track layout. Had to move the Finish Line to make this work. Since on Bielstein some bigger races were held, I did a full Camera Set for this track. This time cuts and timing gates are not as harsh as on Bielstein 🙂\nAs usual, i tested the track on all OEM Bikes. Like Bielstein some parts are a little more difficult on a 250 but still all doable. If you want to go for Hotlaps I recommend using a Reshade that increases Brightness and Contrast. The track erodes a little weird (visually) because I did the Texturing a little differently to look more like Nighttime.\nPhotos\nSpecial Thanks to\nSlingela (<3)\nredrider197\nCodyJames\nPhantomz\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nKleinhau\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4546\nMade for\nBeta 19\n.\nRecommended\nTRACK - mega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/1HVHQaqL#Bz8QWxvYrpIjB7emUNMccyZwbiEQQpb9sM66K8lYKZc\nRecommended\nTRACK - mediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/1f1f104ymvmr82u/Kleinhau.pkz/file\nServer Version\nSERVER - mediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/39xn4ism0t2t981/Kleinhau.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

This is another track I spent a crazy amount of time on so I hope you guys like it. I spent a lot of the time working on texturing techniques and I’m really happy how this one turned out. I mostly tested with the KTM 450 but it rides well for 250s as well.

This week we are honoring all of the Vets out there and bringing awareness to veteran suicide. After the racing we will be posting a link on our discord for anyone who would like to donate to the cause!\nRacing so far has been phenomenal and is only going to get better! If you are interested in joining this series please message me and I will send you the discord for the series! Keep in mind, I’m still a new track builder, so if you have any tips or tricks that could help me out, I’m all ears! This track runs well on the 250 and 450, it has some big lines and is a relatively faster track even though it has a longer lap time than most SX tracks.\nAs you can see we have several longer rhythm sections, including a turning rhythm. Also the longer sand section through a whoop section. This track is ridable for all skill levels but is best for beginner and intermediate SX riders. Gate and pits for 22 riders.\nBig shoutout to RedRider for all the track and pit objects. As well as all his tips that have helped me along the way.\nAlso a big shoutout to Lynds for his video series that got me into track building to begin with.\nYes the PKZ will not match the name of the track. I had already had everything built when the decision was made to change ”Location” to Annapolis.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nRd3.Arlington\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSand\nSoft Soil\nCompact Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 723\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nRd3.Arlington\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/30e6rbr6zwkq34a/Rd3.Arlington.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

It’s inspired by a local track in Brentwood, CA, USA. Known for decades as Sandhill MX Ranch, it was renamed Diablo MX Ranch a few years ago. The track is renowned for its large hill, a defining feature that has always been central to its layout. Although the layout has changed over the years, the main hill has remained a constant.\nThis was the first track I ever rode back in 2005. The replica layout I used reflects the track as it was before it sadly closed to the public in 2023. My goal was to recreate it to preserve its memory before moving on to my next major track build. I aimed to stay true to the original design, with the addition of making every jump and berm larger to suit the game. It rides best on a 125/250f, as a 450 would overjump everything but still provide a nice challenge.\nI hope you enjoy it!\n–\nSpecial thanks to:\nResolute Kraken\nGiopanda\nRedRider197\nKellz & Cody\nPhantomz\nSuperjoint\nTheFluffyGecko\nMake sure to also check out my first track,\nHydraHill\nTHANK YOU!\n– HydraRetro\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nDiabloMX\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 10155\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nRecommended\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/5cJFWTaA#axBUU5R4qm2JlaLRI3Ca9BDkxQu4K7sdsaELz6naudk\nServer Version\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/wdRVzTqJ#oEdspCmschuioBz3WXbl_gxDtrX5lvDR3qVNhbZj3sQ\nRecommended\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-KHwL0eIw_GnQR2lq1Ff8zIruKd7UDtP/view?usp=sharing\nServer Version\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-PnPOGtWM3BoEfzi-edeeBPNSEgf3o7f/view?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\nHydraRetro!\nYour donation will go towards creating tracks and/or track assets!\nBuy me a coffee!",

A bunch of annoying dirt bike drivers have taken over Woodbury County’s previously glorious valley called Sinner’s Cove on the outskirts of Beaverdale, MO. The county’s public riding park featured an MX track that was permanently closed and abandoned as locals claimed it was polluting their beaches.\nThat was before a design and excavation company called ”Checkerz Built” moved in and has let motorbikers roam the valley with no consequence. The lousy business owner most known for doing pop-wheelies while airborne on his offroad moped, added a professionally built Supercross track replica of Seattle’s 2024 race and some sort of ”BMX trails for motorbikers” called Beaverdale Trails MX on his property too.\nNow that biker hooligans have over-run the valley, they have built ramps everywhere from the beach to the docks and even over the massive river.  Bikers are ripping down the road at all hours gaining speed to ramp off massive hills in death defying stunts.  We even saw one biker named Qwestshun JUMPING OVER THE HOUSE that the business owner constructed on the property.\nThe Cove has been over-run by these adrenaline fueled dare devils who are constantly doing burn-outs in the grass and beaches.  Many business owners have left to no longer deal with the biker rebels and only the sleeziest of businesses have been brain-washed by the biker gang to stay open.  They constantly are blaring music, revving their bikes and even party until the early hours of the morning sometimes. Outsiders no longer dare visit the off-road rebel controlled valley, once a glorious vacation paradise and romantic lookout in the Ozarks.\nUntil next week’s episode, this is Kry Baby Karen saying, ”These dirty sinners need to put down their bikes and pick up their bibles to go to church!”\nThe Credits:\nRed/Kellz and Cody/Gio/Earthworks and anyone releasing additional assets for the community to use!\nRK – Track Editor\nTFC – Tutorial vids\nQwestshun – The sky cubes and making me add on and not finalize this track 5 times adding over 200 hours and a couple months to the release\nKeLLz – Not calling me an idiot when I constantly broke things and had questions\nThe boys in KTW for the Beta session laughs\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nSinnersCovebyCheckz\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSand\nSoft Soil\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4926\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nSinners Cove Mediafire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/ggjl915dsksnb7i/SinnersCovebyCheckz.pkz/file\nDefault\nSinners Cove Mega\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/0T8QXL6A#ap2Jg2h9ISuNJwoCKQdYM-hhDk1awPFIxMfcaZAfY4A\nServer Version\nSinners Cove By Checkz Server Version (must unzip file)\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/tin1w0rajz0q5fd/SinnersCovebyCheckz_serverversion.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\nCheckerz_448!\nRocket Fuel isn't cheap, but I am.\nLet's go to the Moon!",

Beginning May 29th One-One Designs and I are hosting a 10 round 250 SX series, which is a part of their full season 250 SMX championship! If you are interested in joining this series, please follow this link to their discord. https://discord.gg/5zvdU9xrbR\nThe tracks for this series will likely cater more to the beginner/intermediate supercross riders. There are a couple corners with alternate lines, the whoops are not too difficult but can cost you time.\nSince this track was built for a 250 championship, that is what the vast majority of the testing was done with. I personally have run a 50.70 as my fastest lap at this point. However, one of the guys helping with testing was able to get into the low 49s.\nI do love good positive criticism and tips. So if there is anything you think I should focus on doing better with, I’d love to hear it!\nJust as with my first track, a massive shoutout to Lynds for his videos which helped me out big time start to understand what it takes to build tracks.\nAn equally as massive shout out to RedRider197. Not only for the stadium and track assets, but for his willingness to help and answer questions that helped me out big time!\nalso a big thanks to Phantomz for the skidsteer asset.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nRD1.Houston\nSoil Types\n(track materials)\nSoft Soil\nSand\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 952\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nRD1.Houston\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/6zi6nw2tuzl4259/RD1.Houston.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

I’ve always been a huge Egypt fan and even spent last summer touring the country for 2 weeks with Dr. Robert Schoch. The track is a completely sand surface so it will take a little bit to get used to riding it. It has a close to realistic scaling and is rough the majority of the way around the track. It’s a challenging track to put together consistent laps(at least for me) but I think it will produce some good racing. I put a crazy amount of hours into this track so I hope you guys enjoy it.\nThanks go to:\nTotes McGoats for learning together and testing\nRedRider197 for the awesome tractors\nGioPanda for the fences and track markers\nAgitato for the banners\nResolute Kraken for the track builder tool\nRosshell*** for the MXGP assets\nDisclaimer: There seems to be some controversy with the Rosshell assets available here on mxb-mods. I have no idea whether they are really ripped or not, but this will likely be my one and only tracking using these assets unless that’s cleared up.\nUPDATE: I accidently included some large JPG and PSDs in my PKZs. Thank you Niko from mxbikes shop for pointing that out. I re-uploaded them without the images so both files should be 150mb smaller.

This week we have a very INTENSE, FUN, SIMI DIFFICULT, HIGH SPEED and the first ever FREE split gate drop start supercross track that i know of built by the one and only Patron. All jumps are custom made meaning i used no template to add a fully new riding experience and style to have a great time and or race with your friends. The inspiration for this track was the 2012 Monster Cup, I used mostly the same layout but added my own personal twist to make it unique and more of a great time to ride.\nTo my knowledge The remainder of the Kelso Cup Rounds are most likely going to be held on mymxb, So make sure you guys sign up for future races if not already.\nSORRY FOR THE TIMING GATE ISSUES IN THE FIRST POST\nHOPE YOU ALL ENJOY AND ANY FEEDBACK BAD OR GOOD IS ALWAYS WELCOME!!!!!!\nHuge Thanks To:\nRedRider – All the SX objects, and limitless help with answering any questions i have\nKelso & Stratos – hosting the series\nBakedminotaurs – always cool about answering questions\nResolute Kraken – track builder helper\nDookiesDad – texture ideas\nLynds – Detailed tutorials\nMOUSE – helping with making sure its on servers\nOtto – letting me know about gates instantly\nIf i left anyone out, please let me know!\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1754\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nMega\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/omox2DLC#OidOuUPbEwkGObT73Uv236ls1K8tAUjdZkNbCdHHTlk\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The stadium is not the best this week but the rhythms and textures are getting better I believe. Wish I had more time on this one. I also did not have time to add banners around stadium unfortunately.  A These tracks are created for the community to get a sneak peak of the track layout for the main series held by ARL. They are not designed to look the greatest given the amount of time I have to build and release each track. I make them to the best of my abilities. I’m looking forward to honing my skills through the season and continuing to give you guys the best tracks possible. Also, I am not affiliated with ARL.\nUPDATE 5/4:\nTrack has been modified.

I’m NuggetBoi and I proudly present you my second track 🙂 I’m sorry that it took a little longer but i focused on improving my skills and listened to your feedback on my last track.\nI still can’t believe that Bielstein wasn’t already in the game. Bielstein is a track with a lot of history. Back in the days (since 1959) GPs took place here. In 1981 the MXoN was held on this beatiful track in western Germany. Nowadays this track is a highlight in the ADAC Masters series.\nThis track has 40 gates. I moved the finishline to make this more elemination race friendly (This time it’s already on the server list. Sorry Aiden).\nIf you are having perfomance issues, turn off 3D Grass. I don’t understand why, but the 3D Grass was creating lags from the beginning of the track making. If anyone know how to fix this, let me know 🙂\nI tested the track on all OEM Bikes. The uphill Step-Up is not easy for 250ccm but is doable (go outside at the bottom of the hill).\nImpressions\nSpecial Thanks to\nSlingela (<3)\nLynds\nRedRider\nNoxo\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nBielsteiner Waldkurs\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 6359\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nRecommended\ntrack - www.mediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/uhbakqdk6ukl64q/Bielsteiner_Waldkurs.pkz/file\nRecommended\ntrack - mega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/YD9GiLDA#UdlCTCMihjjapn-VrS9W4ofT4WMuO-Ba_uYUkBQJX54\nOptional\nserver - www.mediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/jab5qgcaweu5u6i/Bielsteiner_Waldkurs.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nWelcome to Hydra Hill.\nThis is my first track, and it is a fictional track set on my IRL property. I used real world height map data to get the scale and actually went outside and touched grass to help me model the landscape. My goal was to see what a track could look like if I used all my property to build one. Because I only have a humble 5 acres, the track is short and compact but also beginner-friendly since I am new to the game and have put more time into this track than the actual game itself.\nI previously modeled my house and garage to scale, so I used them as a part of the track. You will find yourself racing through the breezeway and in-between the house and garage. The only collisions on the track are the house and garage.\nThere is the main MX track, and outside the main area, there is the example SX track, a bermed Flat Track, an FMX area, and a Trail that loops (watch out for the crashed UFO).\n–\nNOTE: This track was designed for and tested on a 125/250f.\n–\nSpecial thanks to:\nResolute Kraken – Track builder\nTFCMods – Tutorials\nRedRider197 – Assets\nAgitato – Assets\nGiopanda – Assets\nKellz x Cody – Tree Pack\nSuperjoint – Flags\nTheFluffyGecko – Ramps\nPhantomz – Skid Steer\nand Lynds for providing entertainment\nI also have the\nbike stands\nfrom the pits available on the asset page and plan on adding more assets in the future.\nThank you!\n– HydraRetro\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nHydraHill\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 10533\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nRecommended\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/19QvDRjn3aB_t9aGgJOHeL0HNKjdmAlwa/view?usp=sharing\nRecommended\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/4d5gxLYB#bkCDUj-AB0nATVtuyx3R1DE-AtM9sSAXmQbtMQ2TRxY\nServer Version\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/19e_oAN5aAaUFdabAKkvdxzk_wNLrkiFC/view?usp=sharing\nServer Version\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/JdBUnIRb#vzPe2OifqlBra77tDo4cpndW-9ME62O_CfYITqWfvhM\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\nHydraRetro!\nYour donation will go towards creating tracks and/or track assets!\nBuy me a coffee!",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHey Friends!\nYou guys might or might not have been wondering why you haven’t really seen any bike/gear mods from me lately.\nThats because I have been working on this.\nAnyway, this is a fantasy track straight from my brain. I’m still new to track building so\nhelpful/constructive/kind feedback is much appreciated. It means more than you think\nand makes everything worth it so dont be shy!\nFeatures:\n1. Motocross track with some SX/SMX influenced sections\n2. Big floaters\n3. Peaked doubles\n4. Split choice sections (desgigned so that split sections are timed evenly for fair racing)\n5. A long lake that winds throughout the track\n6. The right amount of roughness so its challenging but not punishing\n7. Good elevation change\n8. Made to accomodate all skill levels\n9. Wide variety of obstacles\n10. 40 pits\n11. 30 gates\nRecommendations:\n1. If you mess up in a section dont try to keep jumping through the rest of it. Instead just go around an obstacle or 2\nso you can get your momentum back up. Yeah you’ll get a timing cut or 2 to make it fair for everyone else but you’ll be flowing again.\n2. If you’re able to take corners and maintain good momentum most of the time you’ll want to ride\none of the OEM 250F’s.\n3.If you aren’t the best at keeping momentum or you crash often then hop on something faster like an E10 Factory 250f or OEM 350/450.\n4. Use your brain and be on time or you’re going to wad yourself up.\n5. Don’t trip if you fall in the water. It’s not the easiest to get back onto dry land but definitely\ndo-able if you do fall in.\n6. When in doubt, send it.\nCredits:\nResolute Kracken – Track Building Tool\nRed Rider – Testing, Water/Dump Trucks, and Water Help\nConsumingClouds – Testing/Feedback\nRyan Cardo – Garages\nCody & Kellz – Y Tree Pack\nMatrica – Mask/Chromlum Help\nKingMX818 – Heightmap Info\nThanks:\nRed Rider – You’re awesome and super humble.

I played it for years since it came out and I’ve gotta thank people like Tylyn, Something Rad and Skootypuff Jr for getting me into MX Bikes! This took about a month to make and I wanted to do it right, especially for my second go at track making. It was an interesting process getting the scaling right so that it translates with the physics engine of MX Bikes. You can run a 250 and 450 on here. Multiple available lines like in Reflex. I’m able to clear 90% of the big lines on the 250 myself!\nCREDITS:\nRedRider – Endless amount of help, stadium, gate, finish, bales, and semis assets. An actual GOAT.\nSteezy – Texturing help. Seriously the man for showing me how its done.\nAgitato – Holeshot arch.\nJanes46 – Night skydome.\nKellz & Cody – Trees.\nTheFluffyGecko – FMX ramps and landing.\nDirtTwister – Track map from Reflex. Made doing this quite a bit easier!\nFor video of a lap around the track,\nCLICK HERE\nor click the thumbnail!\nI did really enjoy making this and I wanna put even more tracks out in the future!

They are not designed to look the greatest given the amount of time I have to build and release each track. I make them to the best of my abilities. I’m looking forward to honing my skills through the season and continuing to give you guys the best tracks possible.

I dedicated close to 200 hours to create this track, ensuring every detail was perfect. From meticulously timing the corners to scaling the jumps, I studied race replays to make sure the track rode as close to real life as possible.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHey everyone! it’s been a minute, but I’m back with another track for you! This time I figured I’d give SX a shot. This is my first attempt at a supercross track, so please give whatever feedback you can, so I can make the appropriate changes for the next one.\nThis is the 2024 layout of Philadelphia. The scaling isn’t supposed to prep you for ARL, as I built the track to ride how I want it to, and to cater to a wider demographic. There’s a freshly graded version, which you’ll find in-game called “Media Day”. It’s been made to be easier, with the whoops being the most challenging part of that version. There are some big lines possible, and some technical aspects that can catch you out if you’re not careful. There’s a second version with prebuilt ruts and roughness called “Night Show” to hopefully give everyone a version they will enjoy. Careful though, in this version the track has been thoroughly abused, and the plywood’s starting to show through the bottom of some of the ruts, which are quite deep in some spots, leaving some lines not worth trying unless you need to. This version isn’t supposed to be easy, it’s supposed to push you to be more accurate and reserved to make your way around without dragging bars, or cross rutting.\nI can’t overstate this enough, without RedRider this release would be nothing. Every model you see on this map was made by him. the bales, start gate, finish arch, all the pit objects, and of course this amazing stadium. Which, now that I’m done the track, he will generously be releasing the stadium on mxbmods for EVERYONE to use on their own tracks in the next few days.\nAlso thanks to Earthwurx, stoney for the sauce, HSM for testing.\nI hope you enjoy.\nThanks to Falcon for the preview lap on Media Day, and Mooham for the preview on the night show.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 6706\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nMEDIA DAY TRACK DOWNLOAD\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/F3liBJ5R#Dw-4y6FlQlyKQRZ4IxQ0qiPwA8sgNCPZUZZ08Oyoibw\nDefault\nNIGHT SHOW TRACK DOWNLOAD\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/omkkUZZQ#Drsj8M6NfkYVVjw5qpHrNJ4cWF9GyLGEUZCY90AXJS4\nServer Version\nMEDIA DAY SERVER VERSION\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/g2dnXIZR#quZYzIPdMyjRkGmnK1kBzSNlwQkbGdJ0G0Mxiaq179g\nServer Version\nNIGHT SHOW SERVER VERSION\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/pi0UVRLZ#UOOXbt-YWkhxmYkGifJLjFHCkKwdLaW4yznwpWlGSoY\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Unfortunately didn’t have enough sign ups to run the race, but that doesnt mean the track will stand stagnant.\nA lot of time went into this one, trying to get the scaling dialed and allowing multiple line options in each rhythm section. Track was scaled for 250s, as the series is held to the 250 class only. There are a few quad lines for the 250, so that means the 450s will most likely have some 5s & 6s in some of the rhythms. Track is super technical, but not over the top. That doesn’t hinder the fun aspect of this track, because once u get the lines figured out this track is an absolute blast to spin lap after lap.\nHope you all enjoy!

Back in 2019 I messaged him on Instagram and he allowed me to port this track into MX Bikes. Actually, I even released this track in late 2019 around christmas time as a total bugfest because I’ve been rushing the release and the winter theme was a pretty spontaneous idea.\nEven that the heightmap was pretty much done and I was happy with how it felt in MX Bikes, I never touched the track again.\nUntil now.\nI loved the idea of a winter themed track as we never had anything similiar (besides the Winter Wonderland freeride track), so I dug the old project files up and started using\nResolute Krakens Track Helper\nwhich was a blessing.

It features 1 mx track and 30 freeride jumps that are intertwined around the track. There are 2 different coloured skies – the blue version for clear and the purple sunset version for cloudy. It is a fantasy track with some interesting features set in the deep woodland of the Lake District National Park, UK. Not the widest for racing I am aware but it definitely is a whole vibe! I started building it for factory 250s, though rideable; current 250s are a tiny bit too slow I would recommend OEM 450s or 350s instead. There will be more to come from me I already have 3 other tracks in the works.\nDisclaimer I am not SteezyMX.\nCredits – Slutwalrus and the WFO Racing guys that have done most of the testing. Eltrex aka VM Visuals for helping me with blender. Everyone that helped me in the mod-track section of the mx bikes community discord server: especially Bishop for telling me that its a “cool concept poorly executed” on an early work in progress.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHOWDY DUE EVERYONE!\nThis is my FIRST EVER track release and i wanted it to be a little special and different. What i was able to come up with was a sx test track\nthat was inspired by “2010 ST. Louis Round 14” but with my own personal twist of a long split section that i don’t see sx really have no more.\nI focused on making this Test Track super realistic with making sure lines weren’t unrealistic and being able to send a quad that just doesn’t feel like should be possible, Making sure all lines were able to be hit both on 250 and 450, Making it so your sometimes forced to hit a double because you didn’t have momentum and or scrub properly, Having sharper jumps so it kind of feels like your floating and or jumping decently high so if you were to case in a certain way you would be discipline and most likely crash and go over the bars not just be able to eat the jump and still end up flowing through a section perfectly fine. I would say its a intermediate track it can flow pretty easy but if your really trying to be fast and consistent you have to be pretty good cause it does take scrubbing pretty well to clear on 450 and even more 250. I wanted to do something slightly different then other sx and add kind of a foresty feel to it.\nI truly enjoy this track and so exited to share it with everyone and see the times that can be put down. There is a fun little multiple trails on the outside of the whole tracks that have splits, I wish i put a little more time with the outside trail but i was super anxious to put it out so i didn’t focus to much on that, it isent perfect but i would love all the feedback good and bad to be able to improve in the future have a nice rest of the day\nShoutout To People That HELPED with questions and SUPPORT me\nHelped with questions:\nBakeminotaurs\nZalador\nReviewing the Track/Content:\nIBSKELSO\nSYNN\nAIDEN\nSMOKSTAS\nand everyone that does after uploaded\nOBJECTS: REDRIDER\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nPatron_Test_Track\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 2399\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nMega\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/BzIyDbJL#xZhx3iHS4cNAu8Xyql-KgisQy2RCrxH1Wu3IIoTMbrQ\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

When I left the game/community 3 months ago, I decided that I no longer wanted my tracks to be in the ever growing toxicity that is MX Bikes. After a few months away, I have decided to upload them as a repository, to be one stop place for all my previous tracks that I had permanently deleted. I have started building again but unsure if I will release another anytime soon. (I say that now, and then ill probably end up making a bunch more lol)\n17 Tracks In Total, some of them were made yrs ago, before I even mildly understood optimization (still playable obviously).

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nInstructions\nWhat’s up everyone!\nWhat we have here is a little supercross training compound, packed with 2 supercross track, as well as a fun little free ride area. The 2 SX layouts are based off of 2024 St Louis & 2024 Denver. They’re not fully 100% replicas, but only differ slightly from the irl track maps.\nThe clay (orange) track is St Louis, and the grey dirt track is Denver, or my interpretation of it based on the track maps. Both are somewhat difficult but once u get the lines down shouldn’t be too bad for newcomers to supercross. The whoop sections on both tracks are pretty tough, especially if you thought the whoops on Kelso Cup round 1 were hard. But once you can start hitting them consistent i feel it will more than prepare you for the ARL races. You won’t find these tracks super rough, but I did add some breaking bumps and chop to the courses to add some level of difficulty/immersion.\nTracks work well for both 250s & 450s, most lines are doable on the smaller CC’s but will find u have to stretch some sections slightly. The 450 is an absolute blast to rip, both layouts have a few quad line options.\nYou’ll definitely want to bring the 450 out to the free ride area, as there are a couple massive booters that send you to the moon. I didn’t spend a whole lot of time on this area as the main focus was on the supercross tracks, but if you get bored rippin motos then this is perfect for wanting to chill and hit some fun transfers.\nFor some reason (mainly because I have about 3 brain cells) I wasn’t able to get each track on their own layout, and put everything in one pkz. So, I’ll have a pkz for each layout to download, and if u want both layouts I will have both pkz’s in one zipped folder. Files sizes are somewhat large, which is the reason i’m posting each pkz separately. If size is no problem, simply download the zipped folder, unzip and drag both pkz’s into your mods/tracks folder\nHope you enjoy! It’s not perfect, but it’s fun nonetheless. Each track has 40 pits, and 22 gates so hopefully will see some fun lobbies on both layouts.\nServer versions are going to be added, I am unfortunately having issues signing into the track manager 🙁\nHUGE THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT HELPS AND SUPPORTS ME!!\nEarthWurx –\nknowledge and help, and putting up with my millions of questions\nRed Rider –\nsame as above, still holding strong with a 5 star customer service rating.

It’s a very fast track. Eventhough the reallife track is known for being very smooth, I decided to add a decent amount of ruts and bumps to make the track not so easy and wideopen. The Track has been tested on all the OEM Bikes.\nI had a lot of free space and i couldn’t release the track because this site was down, so i decided to build a fantasy freeride-ish Trail down the road. It’s very tight and technical, but can make a lot fun when you find a good flow. I\nrecommend a 450 to ride the Trail\n.\nImpressions of the Track\np.s.: with 36 Gates and the Start going right over the Finishline, this track is perfect for Elemination Races 😀\nSpecial Thanks to\nLynds\nredrider197\nnoxo\ncody James & Kellz\nphantomz\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nMCC Ohlenberg\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 3889\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nMediafire Download (Riders Version)\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/g2iin6d4321ym98/MCC_Ohlenberg.pkz/file\nOptional\nMediafire Download (Server Version)\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/12ggwvw54m0bju9/MCC_Ohlenberg_server.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

I could honestly spend weeks and weeks tweaking things but for the sake of a first track release I’m happy to release it as it is. I have learnt so much in the 90 hours I’ve spent on this bad boy, multiple programs I’ve never touched before, hours and hours of YouTube tutorials and lots of questions in the Earthwurx discord.\nHere is Riverside MX Re-Imagined! What started as a replica track of a track in the South East of the UK which has been closed for many many years soon turned into a semi-replica once I realised how boring an exact copy would be. So instead, I’ve added loads of extra jumps and ruts that were never there IRL and it really makes it so much better in game.\nThe masking of 3d grass and the transition between off-track and on-track textures could definitely be improved however that’s where my photoshop skills were definitely a limiting factor! The shadows make some ruts intentionally difficult to see just to spice things up a bit and for all of you WFO warriors, I’m afraid there’s a few corners you’re gonna have to slow down for!\nAll jumps can be cleared on a 250, I’m sure they’re also possible on a 125 if you hit the outsides hard enough!\nhttps://youtu.be/bRe8viNkxcE\n(Video will be live 10 minutes after this post)\nA massive thankyou to the following:\nEarthWurx Discord – Helping with any queries and questions\nCody James/Phantomz – Rut brushes for photoshop\nCody James/Kellz – Y Tree Pack\nRedrider – Semi Pack/EzUp Pack/Various Machinery\nNavo – Vans\nJesse Mulock – Pickup Truck/TrackEd Tutorial\nGiopanda – Acerbis Track Marker/Tree Billboards\nPhantomz – Skidsteer\nTheFluffyGecko – FMX Ramps\nResolute Kraken – Track Builder Helper/Youtube Tutorials\nTFC – Youtube Tutorials\nApologies if I missed anyone out.\nSomebody randomly added this girl to the post but she’s quite attractive so she can stay\nFeedback is always welcome but I’ll be away for about 6 days now so any meanies will be left unread 🙂\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nRiverside MX\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 7254\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nRecommended\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1uuAv6sbgx2pK6nHvgQtbxGeJV9hPG8XP/view?usp=sharing\nServer Version\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-luO1UXZdRW37gBwVgktG5qBJPkh3TLO/view?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Trying to get ahead of the curve again, expect Seattle soon. It’s a constant battle to find time but I should have Seattle out before next Friday. On another note,\nThese tracks are designed for riders to get a sneak peak of the track layout for the main series held by ARL. They are not designed to look the greatest given the amount of time I have to build and release each track. I do the best I can, work my ass and make them to the best of my abilities.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nIts getting near the end of the season and warm out, its starting to melt but we pushed all the snow we could to keep the place together for one last ride before the township may even shut us down. We called a couple race teams out for a last practice, while the ramp guys stole one of the Skidsteers and got the ramp hits all in check.\nWelcome to “The Compound Lot.” My first track release for the Snocross Pack\n.\nBased on an edge of town setting, this freeride/snocross practice park built on a dead end road just on the edge of town. I’d made this place while learning height maps and track building.\nUsing the example track files as my base, id attempted to remake the example track heightmap in photoshop with many changes to scale and jump faces. All focused on finding the balance of fun and realism of a snocross track.\nWe grew up riding ramps, and i had this old file lying around of a Freestyle Snowmobile Ramp id made a long time ago. Which quite luckily rides really well in MXB with no changes. Theres 3, a Super Kicker, Comp Ramp and a long Distance out in the back of the yard.\nBefore I experimented with making Freestyle ramps in my height map instead of objects. Which worked. But this Snow hit here, will kick the front end high and make flips much easier for upside down tricks. Wasn’t my intention but it worked so well i said the hell with it and left it in the middle of “The Ramp Six Pack”.\nTheres alot of fun Hits at The Compound Lot. 2 Six Packs, one focusing on Snow Jumps while other focused on Ramps (With the Flip Snow Hit). A bigger gap loop around the property. Please be respectful of the old cabin out back and clean up after yourselves.\nI learned alot on this, and many changes still could have been made but really wanted to get something out for guys to ride some sleds on. No reason you cant rip a bike around here either though, Snocross track is Sand based and jump sections are Soft soil based.\nI have another track that im working on that is only Snocross/National style focused for racing, so i decided to stop tweaking this to get it done, and for everybody to enjoy this on. Its my first track, its not perfect, the track is very simple but the map gives a good vibe and alot of fun. I hope everybody enjoys my FIRST track release.\nAll objects are free and licensed for use. But id like to thank these guys on MXB for already having some assets made to the public for use, so i didnt have to build and convert files in blender as much lol.\nCurrently only works in testing until the server file is uploaded.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nThis is my first track for MX Bikes. I used to create tracks for MCM2 and Reflex and finally picked this game up to start building tracks for it. The tracking creating process is head and shoulders above any of the previous games thanks to tools like Resolute’s track builder and all the PiBoSo tools included in it as well as iNsane’s .pkz locker. There’s also such a good library of videos put out by the community to help. Huge shout out to all those guys. Also a big thanks to Ruubs(or maybe Sandbiter) for the trees, GioPanda for the Tents and porta pottys, RedRider for the semis, and PDR for a tuffblock base that I was able to texture. Thanks to my buddy Totes MickGOATs for learning the track creation process with me and exchanging tips and beta testing.\nThis is a realistic style national track with a lot of rutted corners for different line choices. It’s mostly rough with a few booters but nothing too big. There’s also an FMX area to play around on and a trail that goes around the edge of the map.  I’m still new to the game so it’s pretty much impossible for me to get a clean lap so I’ll be interested what people can do on it. My fastest is 2:00 with no crashes. I found anywhere from 1.0-2.0 deformation works pretty well but over that it gets a little too rough to fall into the ruts. One last thing is I wasn’t sure which beta version to choose when uploading the track and didn’t find anything in steam or the game that told me which version I’m on so I just picked the newest version.\nI hope you guys enjoy it!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nValley View Ranch\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 10970\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nMega - Track PKZ\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/L0cVlb7R#L_3igAxLy52o2k0DijRhDpZhmEfFfUuSNAQQgNEnGv8\nDefault\nMega - Server PKZ\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/2os3QBjY#eY_1gXpbB49okMvCXAlwdYL-WG9dpEDbcCKPeNN8AZQ\nDefault\nGoogle Drive - Track PKZ\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1JGsyMTUM9kUCPr42vt7ncahLndqrvf2-/view?usp=sharing\nDefault\nGoogle Drive - Server PKZ\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12wHtlCVOKzGTOw5jaHswQg-zjn-lYMNY/view?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nInstructions\nWhat’s up everyone!\nWhat we have here is round 2 of IBSKelso’s series, called the Kelso Cup. This weeks track brought the intensity with a technical, “make or break” rhythm section. This round was built by yours truly, didn’t get the jump template fully dialed in but i think it adds to the difficulty ever so slightly. Round 2 was last week, the plan is to release each track an hour before the race starts on kelsocup.com for free. After the event is over, the track will be released here.\nAny rumors going around of this series “trying to take over the ARL series” is absurd and childish. It’s a completely new format of racing and just gives players another avenue to race. This is in no way, shape, or form, to discredit or take anything from mxbmods, mxbshop, or mymxb. There’s enough division in the game, some think there has to be a “meta” with everything and that takes away enjoyment from the whole game.\nHave fun! Details for Round 3 can be found in Kelso’s discord, as well as www.kelsocup.com\nNone of this would have been possible without the following;\nEarthwurx – answering any questions i have, and showing me ze way\nRed Rider – All the supercross objects, and help with my annoying questions <3 5 star customer service rating\nStoneRider – For the sauce\nJackie Moon – Catch Nets\nJesse Mulock – help with tracked stuffs\nLogan aka Mr Earthwurx – helping me out with the jump template\nITZP4NDA – help with build\nIBSKelso – hosting the series, and giving me positive encouragement\nStratos – same as above, and the main guy behind building the website and setting up the races\nResolute Kraken – track builder helper & tutorials\nThank you to everyone that helped test this as well! If I missed anyone, please feel free to let me know!\nALSO, the file size is a tad large, but that's due to the baseball stadium i used. everything is as optimized as it can be, so shouldnt really have issues with lag or frame drops\nSERVER VERSION HAS BEEN ADDED TO DEDI LIST!

This track raced really well, has some fun sections, and is great for casual riding. Round 1 was last week, the plan is to release each track an hour before the race starts on kelsocup.com for free. After the event is over, the track will be released here.\nAny rumors going around of this series “trying to take over the ARL series” is absurd and childish. It’s a completely new format of racing and just gives players another avenue to race. This is in no way, shape, or form, to discredit or take anything from mxbmods, mxbshop, or mymxb. There’s enough division in the game, some think there has to be a “meta” with everything and that takes away enjoyment from the whole game.\nThe start gate does have slight collisions, I left them be because i felt it added another layer of difficulty and seemed to work out ok.\nHave fun! Details for Round 2 can be found in Kelso’s discord, as well as www.kelsocup.com\nNone of this would have been possible without the following;\nEarthwurx – answering any questions i have, and showing me ze way\nRed Rider – All the supercross objects, and help with my annoying questions <3\nStoneRider – For the sauce\nJackie Moon – Catch Nets\nJesse Mulock – help with tracked stuffs\nLogan aka Mr Earthwurx – helping me out with the jump template\nITZP4NDA – built rough heightmap\nIBSKelso – hosting the series, and giving me positive encouragement\nStratos – same as above, and the main guy behind building the website and setting up the races\nThank you to everyone that helped test this as well!

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\n**Track updated** Went through the whole track and added improved roughness. Eroded jump faces and more pronounced braking/accelerating bumps have been added. With jump face erode, body position on the bike is crucial due to a kickers on the faces. Texture masks have also been tweaked a bit and overall definitely an improved and fun track to ride. Some of the smaller bikes should have an easier time clearing the big jumps as well with the new jump faces and well.. the new OEMs.\nThis is a replica track of my hometown track that has recently closed down in Bartow Florida. This is the first time I have created a track and I felt that it would be a pretty straightforward and fun track to build.\nThe track is built in an old phosphate mining area so in real life it is dry, sandy and gypsum stacks line the horizon. with that said, I still decided with going the soft soil route. With this, the track features some acceleration bumps in certain corners and a touch of general roughness which really starts to show once the track gets eroded. A 250 can clear every jump on the track but in some turns a 450 (like real life) will certainly have an advantage. Overall the track is fast and momentum will give you the advantage. Track is a 1 to 1 scale so it is a little narrow but works well.\nThe track layout is a mixture of the 2009 layout mixed with a little bit of 2010 layout. From the finish line through the big 120+ footer in the back and through to the rhythm section, its 2009. From there to the finish it is modeled after 2010 when they decided to incorporate a tighter “supercross inspired” setup. For the start area, it is different then real life and is going to cause havoc in online lobbies (use your brakes), but if you get through clean then you are set.\nHopefully some people can enjoy this track and maybe this can give some people in my area the chance to ride their favorite track while growing up once again.\n*Feel free to leave some feedback! Again could always update add some more roughness/more aggressive braking bumps and acceleration bumps.*\nHuge thanks to anybody who helped me on discord, TFC’s and Resolutes videos, and Redrider197, Kellz & Cody, Ryan Cardno, Agitato, and Phantomz for the Assets\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nBartow Motocross\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 9218\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nBartow Motocross.pkz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/h6cFWSoS#vnXxCaTQrNc7FJOVx8hezYKLghsqrL6ByE5j6UtXKzs\nServer Version\nBartow Motocross(serv).pkz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/86Um3AQZ#V9y5r_hRJG9SF1GghxTysvfPS6OJ0zyx876VZ0xcHZw\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

This track is a track called CoonabarabranMX or Goanna Tracks, it is a super fun track in real life that I have and always will love riding the dirt is always good there and the jumps and ruts are mad.Heres somethings about the track [in game] it has 48 gates along with 48 pits with semis, water trucks, trees, and much more, this is a first time using objects for me and you can really tell the difference with objects and without objects, they can really make the place pop!! All the jumps are easy on a 250-450 although there is 1 or 2 jumps thet may be a bit difficult throughout the track, anyway I hope you enjoy this long time built and hardworked track cant wait to see some reviews – AJ45\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nCoonabarabran MX\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1498\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nCoonabarabranMX normal version\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/zc33w0vg51rvhsz/AJ45_-_CoonabarabranMX.rar/file\nServer Version\nCoonabarabranMX server version\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/oed0qjv9rfyytil/AJ45_-_CoonabarabranMX%25282%2529.rar/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

It is Located in Glendale Arizona (let me know if I should scale the track a little bit bigger and I will update it) searching for proper scaling has been a challenge but I’m so close. Thank you\nNext week Arlington will be released beginning of week, Monday or Tuesday. Sorry for delay guys. No these tracks are not way off scaling and they don’t mess with our muscle memory. Its no different than Haiden Deegan building a replica of Detroit and grinding out his own version of the track, which he recently did. Have fun, spread the love and support every rider in this small niche community. This layout was extremely difficult for whatever reason. The goal is to continue to progress. With that being said these tracks are designed for riders to get a sneak peak of the track layout for the main series held by ARL. They are not designed to look the greatest given the amount of time I have to build and release each track. I do the best I can, work my ass and make them to the best of my abilities. Also I am not affiliated with ARL. Im looking forward to honing my skills through the season and continuing to give you guys great tracks\nI will be releasing every round of The 2024 Monster Energy Supercross season.\nThis series came together thanks to Jordan | PDR x Sentinel, Follow him on Discord.

It means more than you think.\nPlease & Thanks Guys! Much love!\nTrack Info:\nThis track is made to have fun on while still being challenging/technical at the same time. It’s not meant to be a hardcore 1:1 scale track that punishes you severely.\nGreat flow and each section compliments the next if ridden properly which is pretty rewarding. There’s a few multilple choice split sections but they are setup to be evenly timed to make it fair for racing (one line is not faster than the other and vise versa).\nEverything is do able on an OEM 250f but you have to be on your game to make most of the jumps. The OEM 350f/450f have no trouble making everything. All race data is done properly so its raceable. 32 gates 40 pits.\nCredit:\nReso – track building program\nTFC, baked minotaurs, endo, & mouk lab – tutorials\nGiopanda, AGMX – assets\ncody & kellz – Y tree pack\nRyan C – Garage pack\nvegi – testing\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nWest MX\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 5855\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nmega player version\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/6AEDhbCQ#3JB69amE_sXhvud3XIJwQYRkHnvr44HSrTIN7JZsE84\nServer Version\nserver version\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/rVM0gADb#28-5YTl1MnFJGQJWex_HX1kuxcxgihlSWH2Q_VRuF7s\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

It is Located at Ford Field Detroit MI.\nNo these tracks are not way off scaling and they dont mess with our muscle memory. Its no different than Haiden Deegan building a replica of Detroit and grinding out his own version of the track, which he recently did. Have fun, spread the love and support every rider in this small niche community. This layout was extremely difficult for whatever reason. I made it to the best of my ability and hope the scaling is okay. I struggled for nights on the scaling of the rhythm sections.  goal is to continue to progress. With that being said these tracks are designed for riders to get a sneak peak of the track layout for the main series held by ARL. They are not designed to look the greatest given the amount of time I have to build and release each track. I do the best I can, work my ass and make them to the best of my abilities. Also I am not affiliated with ARL. Im looking forward to honing my skills through the season and continuing to give you guys great tracks\nI will be releasing every round of The 2024 Monster Energy Supercross season.\nThis series came together thanks to Jordan | PDR x Sentinel, Follow him on Discord.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHey everyone planned for this to come out a couple days ago but the track objects and textures just was not where I wanted them to be but anyways the whole point of this track is to be a full replica of what they raced in real life as each track has changes from the track map to what they race, of course this one is a dry version and not a mudder like they had but the layout is now fully correct. I plan to make every weeks track but drop it a week after the race possibly a little earlier depending on how long it takes me. This is my first track so I want everyone to give me feedback of what they’d like to see better! I plan on each track getting better and better each round or so I hope and will take in everyone’s feedback to make the best feeling tracks! I am planning to make a series also I’m not to sure if it will be these upcoming rounds or if I will decide to make a bunch of custom supercross tracks but I do plan on at least doing a series at some point! Let me know your guys thoughts and if I should do a series with the replicas or do a custom track series! I hope everyone enjoys of all skill levels I tried to make it where newish type players can get on and somewhat get around the track but also add to where there’s a skill gap. Thanks to the Mx Simulator forms for the some of the objects and credits to Redrider for the toughblocks:) also shout out to everyone that tested my track! I hope to only grow from here and bring the community together and let everyone’s feedback go into my tracks! I’m always happy to answer questions and take in feedback thank you! Hope yall enjoy once again:) Will have a discord link in my profile for you guys to see what I’m working on for the future and also to give a more detailed feedback message! I also have a donation link in my profile for anyone who wants to help me out to putting money into better quality stadiums and textures\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nAffinity San Deigo RD 3 2024\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 6388\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nSERVER Version\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rh_En5P39GlJ4KO9dwsHOlSDlr37qoN-/view?usp=sharing\nDefault\nGoogleDrive\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1TKp-hTnuJw5GXBI4Q_PBNzXDV1XyKdE3/view?usp=sharing\nDefault\nMediafire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/cv6ubft5j6xfkjq/San_Diego.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The layout is from the early 2000s, but some of the jumps are custom as I don’t remember everything. The track was\ndeveloped on a 450\n, so you 250 riders might have to stretch to hit all of the jumps.\nSimilar to my first track, I did not go crazy with environment objects, but added trees (Thank you Kellz & Cody). Water wasn’t working for me so I just applied the texture. Shoutout to RedRider for doing the rut texture and providing the banner package and water textures.\nThanks again to Resolute for his track editor helper and to TFC for how to approach replicas.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nHardrock.pkz\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 16307\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nRecommended\nHardrock.pkz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/C7hm2a5b#-OWABLd7ekdWEUbtpPU-Tdx-5l-eR64vP4hLoA4Vft0\nDefault\nHardrock.pkz\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mv6hRgQDxXQICTLdAHK1za8-rUh64ase/view?usp=sharing\nServer Version\nServer Version: Hardrock.pkz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/eno1mRzB#ssn-y0bwbRE8ZWUx67Pys54hpYj0EptYiNXsHunESZg\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Those big hills with the trails on the spines of the hills, and dirt ramps made by locals to scrub over them.\nFeatures\nMapped trail with timing gates, minimal signage to mimic Dakar style racing where you rely on the map and a few signs. I’ve done an 11 minute lap time and I recommend the enduro bikes if you’re looking to have a good lap time because 2 or 3 of the hills on the mapped trail are pretty gnarly but I have completed every hill on a 450 without pushing so it is doable on race bikes if you want to. Another reason for the minimal signage is for you to make your own trail, mine might not be what you see in the landscape, and with all the jumps and overlapping trails that aren’t even part of the main trail, you can have some unique trail rides every time.\n40 dirt ramps placed in strategic positions around the trails to land on the hills that make up the trails.\nAnimals – The Bear looks over the land, The Deer are all just hangin’ out, and The Lizard lurks along the outskirts.\nNight mode – select either of the non-Clear weathers and it will be night time.\nSpecial Thanks To:\nResolute Kraken – Track builder\nBishop – Skybox tutorial video\nCody/Kellz – Bushes and Trees\nCallum22 – Dirt Ramps (from his Supercross template)\nAnyone who made a tutorial on the track building process.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nCalifornia Trails\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 22180\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nTrack\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/rd5zfohf45nf804/California_Trails.zip/file\nDefault\nServer Version\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/mt5cni4u0564l44/California_Trails_Server.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

This ambitious project was a personal challenge to craft a fully functional track in less than a week, had a few days to spare but wanted to get it released for the holidays. Track was tested using the new RM450 OEM’s.\n🌐 While this initial release may not boast the finest textures, it serves as a canvas to showcase the primary focus — the heightmap. I was hoping to recreate all of the 2014 Supercross tracks week by week, not sure when ill start releasing.\n🚧 Keep in mind that this project is a work in progress. If the response is positive and the community shows interest, future track releases will have better textures, finer details, and an overall more polished aesthetic. Your feedback is crucial in shaping the evolution of this project, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts and suggestions.\nThanks to:\nRedRider\nTFC\nGiopanda\nResoluteKraken\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\n2024 A1 Press Day.pkz\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 8491\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/lamke7vdde5n79u/2024+A1+Press+Day.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nInstructions\nWhat’s up everyone!\nAfter what I was planning on being my first paid track release, I thought about it some more and decided that what I have here is not a shop quality track. I feel like it would be a slap in the face to the better track creators, and the community altogether. I could have spent more time on it, but after 350 hours I kind of got burnt out after I realized I wasn’t 100% satisfied with it. I’m still happy with the compound, dont get me wrong! I personally feel it could have been even better.\nWith that being said,\nWelcome to Moto Land! You’re very own private training compound that features 3 tracks, with 4 different layouts.\nThere is a “Pro Track” which is a more narrow layout, with the main focus on being more precise on what your doing\nThe “Amatuer Track” is a little bit wider, has some more forgiving jumps, and I feel suits newer players a little better.\nThe supercross track will have 2 layouts;\n“Orange Dirt” is considered your normal SX layout, though the rhythms are slightly tamed down and not as steep.\n“Grey Dirt” section is considered the “Pro” section, bigger scaled jumps, more line options, and tougher whoop section.\nI only have race data for the Pro Track. I am trying to finish up the other 3 layouts but ended up losing my rdf data by overwriting it by accident and atm I wont have time to finish it all due to the holidays.\nI wanted to have a complete polished track but instead of not releasing today, I will at least give u this for the time being.\nTrack was tested with both OEM and E10\nI hope u all enjoy!\nThis wouldn’t be possible without the following;\nEarthWurx – help & advice with all my annoying questions\nResolute Kraken – track builder helper & tutorials\nRed Rider – 90% of the objects on this track are his <3 & help with my questions & testing\nParaMoto – van object\nJesse Mulock – truck object & testing\nRyan Cardno – Warehouse object\nDylan Frisch – fence object\nStudio Frisch – epic logo & thumbnail\nBenny Visuals – Release edit & testing\nAll the youtube guys; Lynda, Doc, Scizy, Kelso, Stratos, Smoksta for the positive encouragement and feedback & testing\nRuubs & RaceKar – texture norms (was given permission from both to use)\nI will try my best to get the other 3 tracks race data as soon as possible! I’m sorry for the inconvenience. And as soon as Niko gets back from vacation I will have a server version!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAZUDctWhmg&t=8s\nIf u would like to donate, It’s ABSOLUTELY not necessary, but is GREATLY appreciated!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nMoto Land\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 6873\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nmediafire (Pro Layout)\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/dt010e9n0cfcowz/Moto_Land.pkz/file\nServer Version\nSERVER MEGA\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/1SUnGLyB#lHfsjRHo9NlrS1gCTClpb-Pg8EIX1NVfsUhFImy3XzQ\nMod Instructions\nDrag and drop Moto Land.pkz into your track folder.

This version is 10x more rider friendly with a little bit larger scaling. The skybox was also changed from sunset to full moon/ starry night.\nThis is my first supercross build and it was tricky as heck getting the scaling of the jumps right. I think I did a fairly good job. I went through 6 or so different renditions and layouts until finally settling on 2024 Anaheim.\nI will be releasing every round of 2024 Monster Energy Supercross season.\nThis all came together thanks to Jordan | PDR x Sentinel, Follow him on Discord. It never would have seen the light of day if it weren’t for him. Thanks, and I hope you enjoy your custom track bro!

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nDade City Motocross is a classic motocross track in central Florida where James Stewart and Ricky Carmichael grew up racing. This Track has 2 raceable layouts, an outer trail, and a sand jump freestyle oval that is hidden in the woods along the trail.\nThe Raceway layout is the shorter version. It’s based on what the track was like in July 2023. They race at night so I did my best to replicate night time conditions.\nThe Extended layout is the larger version. I did a little creativity on the layout this version and made it go into the woods so it’s even longer than usual. This layout is ran once a month and from what I can tell they only run it from 9am to noon so I made the sun be where it is in the morning for this one.\nI included the track files. The more tools available for track building, the better. I’ve included a separate download with all the track files, heightmap PSD, texture map PSD, blender file with all the objects, skyboxes, everything you would need to make your own version of this track (they change the layout so often, you might have a favorite layout that’s different from this) or to make a whole new track, all the jumps, berms, and whoopdedoos are all separate objects in the heightmap PSD and you can move them, scale them rotate, anything you need. I’m not the first to do something like this, Calumdesigns made a template that’s probably easier to use than this, I used it on Reborn Valley.\nUpdate:\nUpdated rut norms to 4k\nUpdate again:\nFixed traction issue in certain areas\nUpdate again:\nReduced late pop-in textures, Raceway version is now night time, better skyboxes on all versions\nI hope you all enjoy.\nCredits:\nGandolf420Kush – testing\nRedRider + TypicalCanadian + Bishop + Gandolf + the whole tracks channel of the Discord in general – Help and Advice\nResolute Kraken – track builder and tutorial\nBaked Minotaur – rut normal tutorial\nRed Rider – Water objects\nCody + Kellz – Trees\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nDade City.zip\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 5502\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nMega - Track\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/IvEBkQwb#FESfeDtk-kBkbycnKJ7KVzrBesMoz14YiqLCb3x21lE\nDefault\nMega - Server Version\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/1mMxmKQZ#gcxd55-0uZcrgXMTGTmyD8GlzMED2L_5yrW5YPwCNbc\nDefault\nTrack Creation Files\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/suFSULCT#F5RL7hRlMCQTOYj-3ZwGAO8VTbXfgylumxtNGlJe3jE\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nInstructions\nUPDATE OCTOBER 27, 2023:\nWhat’s up boys!\nI’ve decided to break open a previous track I made and completely remaster it with all new textures, objects, and more. This was the 2nd compound I have ever made, and was really just getting my feet wet\nThe supercross track has been completely rebuilt, has 24 pits but only 10 gates\nThe sand track has been updated with centerlines but there is no start gate, so its more of a practice/turn track. Also has 24 pits\nThe main motocross track has a few minor heightmap tweaks, just to make it flow a little better. 40 pits, and 40 gates\nSoft Soil used across entire map\nI upscaled everything, the original was 1:1 scale but found it super tight and just not really enjoyable. The timing gates around the 3 tracks aren’t super strict, but if you try and scumbag some lines you’re lap will most likely not count. Skydome image is a little wonky, so just try to ignore that. I may update with corrected skydome texture in the future\nThank you to everyone that has helped me along my journey\nAnd special thanks to;\nEarthWurx – for guiding me and answering any questions I have\nResolute Kraken – Track builder and tutorials\nRed Rider- EarthWurx bales and banner, Water & Dump trucks, EarthWurx machines\nJesse Mulock – Help & truck object\nRyan Cardno – Warehouse & garages\nDylan Frish – Fence object\nParaMoto – Camper\nKellz – helped me figure out my tree issues\nMoukLabs – Skydome object, and tutorials\nBishop & Typical Canadian – for roasting my textures and inspiring me to redo them and make them look even better than what i had\nFluke – help 🙂\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUPDATE JANUARY 24, 2023:\nHey everyone, hope you have been enjoying so far. I updated the main mx track centerline and I also figured out my soil issue. I fixed some jumps and made it all around more enjoyable. I’ll have more updates as I continue to fix small things. SX track will get an overhaul as well\nHUGE thank you to Jesse Mulock, this update wouldn’t have happened so quick if it weren’t for him\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhat’s up everyone! Excited to present you with the 2020 version of The Ferry Compound. This is the home of retired pro motocross and supercross racer Tim Ferry, along with his son, Evan.\nThis will be my second release, but the first track I released is a WIP. I put a lot of time into this, and tried to get it as close to exact as possible. Some slight differences but nothing too drastic.\nOn this compound you will find a motocross track, supercross track, and a sand track. I’m not that great at building SX tracks so go easy on me. I was having problems with my centerlines unfortunately, but will have those fixed shortly.\nI really hope you all enjoy this compound. None of this would even be possible without the help from the following:\nTFC- track tutorials, Track Assets, Skies, and water truck\nRyan Cardno- Garage Pack\nPhantomz- Skid Steer\nAnd everyone in the discord for helping me with my thousands of questions, I appreciate you all <3\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 5505\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nmega.nz (2020 FERRY COMPOUND)\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/QfVBWBiZ#W2K6lSfY4lVAXHEdUWHuoOGkb_FhvC67OmagKKspVw4\nServer Version\nmediafire (SERVER VERSION)\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/y8firrtcc0drpm9/2020FerryCompound.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\nDownload 1st mega.nz & unzip the 2020FerryComp.rar, open the folder and drag the 2020FerryCompound.pkz, FerryCompoundSX.pkz, & FerryCompoundSand.pkz into your mods/track folder\nmediafire is Server Version",

The track was made for OEMs but factory bikes also work well on the track. I wanted to perfect my supercross “template” with this track, hence why it is a bit longer.

You’re one and only dedicated Supercross campground.\nThis track was originally going to be a throwaway, as I wanted to learn sx building and get scaling dialed in for my compound i’m currently working on. But, I was enjoying it too much and decided I would go all in on this and try to create something every mxb player can enjoy.\n26 pits, & 22 gates\nThe layout is based off of 2009 Anaheim 3, there are a few section changes so it’s not an exact replica. I find the difficulty getting around the track is pretty easy, but to nail the big lines takes a little more finesse and patience. The template is made by MatRob from Mx Sim with some slight adjustments to the transitions, but I also have a few sections that were made with the Earthwurx SX template.\nIMO track is easier to ride on a 450, but a few animals have informed me that a 250f has no problem handling these big lines.\nHope you enjoy! It’s not perfect, by any means. I could’ve put in more time but I’m pretty happy with where it sits.\nNone of this would be possible without;\nEarthwurx – all the positive encouragement and help from these guys, it’s insane\nResolute Kraken – Track Builder Helper & tutorials\nJesse Mulock – TrackEd tutorial and testing feedback. He says if u can’t clear everything on a 250f then you’re just washed XD\nMouk Labs – Skydome texture and object, various Youtube tutorials, and for simply being a straight up G\nShadeyWadey – Flag model and tutorials (my flag texture is placed incorrectly, I just couldn’t be bothered to fix it. We’ll get it next time boys)\nSlabz – Handicap capable restrooms for all your bowel moving needs\nHiggo – Grass objects\nGiopanda – Track assets\nKewinFuela – Sponsor Billboard Signs\nCalum22 – Linking a few various buildings\nScizy – Testing feedback and positive encouragement\nBenny Visuals – Amazing track edit and thumbnail pics, as well as feedback on the track itself\nRyan Cardno – Warehouse\nAnd a VERY special thanks to the following;\nRedRider – Helped me figure some things out. Helped fix my tree issue, fixed my 90 corners, and gave me great feedback along the way. Also, 99% of the objects on this track were made by Red. (archway, gates, bales, finish banner, machines,  tents, water, water truck, bleachers.) Please take a moment to check out the amazing camp tents he did specially for me. Red is one of the main reasons any of us track builders progress, hands down.\nKellz – Helped me retrieve my flag from outerspace\nIf I left anyone out (which I probably am) then please feel free to call me out and I will have it updated. Also, please let me know where I can improve!

There are very fast lines for experienced players and slower lines for new players. The track is roughly a minute long and consists of some unique sections including some wheel taps. The track was made for OEMs but factory bikes also work well on the track. I wanted to make a supercross track with a different vibe then a stadium so I decided to put in the middle of a city. I got a few things to improve on for future tracks but I am happy with how this one turned out.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nSmall Update: Fixed 1 layer thickness for better erode. Noticed just after posting!\nHello Everyone,\nThe track is a replica of the 2006 Spring Creek MX National in which Ricky Carmichael lapped the entire field. I was in attendance for the race and always wanted to build it for mx bikes. I tried placing most of the exact replica banners, and some of the track signage around the track where possible. Track features 40 gates and pits, track cameras, and marshals.\nThis project was in my folder so I got it into decent shape for release. I hope you enjoy it. Scaling was started before all the updated OEM’s and Factory bikes. The factory bikes are rocket ships so I would not go bigger than a 250f.\nLastly, after 12 tracks and almost exactly 2 years, I have decided to hang up my boots and let the more talented track makers do their thing. The demands of IRL commitments makes it impossible to devote the time needed to make good, quality tracks. Rather than building, I’ll simply be enjoying the new creation releases. This also means I will not be doing the 2024 SX Prep tracks this year.\nTHANK YOU to the community members, track makers, and streamers for your support and positive comments. I always looked forward to seeing your track review/previews after releasing a track. I will still be riding online so if you see me out there say hi.\nCredits and Thanks:\n• Red Rider – Testing, Track Assets, Semi , and for answering my many questions!\n• ENDO –textures, and for answering my many questions!\n• Resolute Kraken – Resolute Builder\n• Agitato – Various Objects\n• GioPanda – Various Objects\n• TFC – Tutorials, Water Truck\n• Cody & Kellz – Tree asset (used for desert trees/bushes)\nIf you want to see the progression over the last 2 years here are links to my tracks.\n1.\nHurricane Hills MX MN\n2.\nMidway MX\n3.\nMeadow Valley MX\n4.\nBCMX Adventure Park\n5.\nAMBC RND2 Moree Motorcycle Club\n6.\nTerrafirma Pro National\n7.\n2023 SX Prep Rounds 1-7, 9\n8.\n2023 SX Prep Part 2 – Rounds 10-17\n9.\nBP73 Moto Ranch\n10.\n212 Moto Ranch\n11.\nDesert Sands Raceway\n12. 2006 Millville\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\n2006.Millville - Eraaks212\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 16757\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nMEDIAFIRE - RIDER VERSION\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/khx8n7mh1ollxkj/2006.Millville+-+Eraaks212.pkz/file\nDefault\nMEGA - RIDER VERSION\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/l5MAnY7Z#FO77qaJONFvr4X1FTTuklxhe-OaxAHbNJ2AUdH60Xd4\nServer Version\nMEDIAFIRE - SERVER VERSION\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/2nx5be1xxz22h3i/2006.Millville+-+Eraaks212.pkz/file\nServer Version\nMEGA - SERVER VERSION\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/g1lyxL4S#JhC_L2etiKNHLr3oKWmcji-v7FM1p3tm0V0MZIYzQAw\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\neraaks212!\nIf you like my content please consider donating but please know it is not required.

I’ve had this track sitting in my WIP folder untouched for the last few months so I figured it was probably time to just release it. Some of you may recognize this track because it was my first track I put out over a year and a half ago now… Crazy. However this one is completely different, I wasn’t happy with that first one as it honestly sucked and I knew I could do better, another thing is that I grew up riding this track and still do every now and then so it is kind of special to me so I wanted to do this right. So about a year ago I was looking into how to 3d scan a track with a drone but I wouldn’t have been able to make that happen, then I eventually found out about Lidar. This completely changed everything because it gave me a somewhat accurate base heightmap to go off of and just made the whole process way easier. Fast forward a few months and now we have a remaster/remake of War Eagle MX.\n(Before anyone says anything about it being called the “2023” version, I started on this over a year ago before they turned the track around and already had a decent amount of hours before that)\nNow a lot of this wouldn’t have been possible without the help and support of some friends so this track is dedicated to them.

This map contains a\n4k\nheightmap so you should try riding it with high erode to see what the ruts look and feel like. The heightmap was originally taken from Google Earth 3d scan of the city but I reworked and remastered it to be ideal for the game and I’m really happy with how it turned out. The texture is also from the 3d scan, it is in\n8k\nalong with the normal map with the same impressive resolution. You can see that the track visuals is based on the 3d grass but it comes with a pretty huge performance cost so\nif you experience big fps drops I suggest you to turn off 3d grass at a cost of the track visual quality!\nBig thanks to my friend\nOmitDolomit\nwho helped me with the ideas and photos of the track\n<3\nAlso thanks to\nCody James and Kellz\nfor the trees.\nHope you enjoy this track!

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nWelcome to Poor Boyz MX! This is my first attempt at track building and I’d love to hear your feedback so I can make better tracks in the future.\nThere are 3 raceable tracks included – the main motocross track, a pit bike track, and a trail loop that weaves around the map and crosses over the main track. All 3 layouts have 42 pits and 40 gates for maximum chaos. Or you can just chill and mess around in the corn field FMX circuit.\nThe Main motocross track Is a replica of a private backyard track in Southern Ontario, Canada that I used to ride regularly before I unfortunately had to hang up the helmet. I wanted to create a track for all skill levels to enjoy, so being close to 1:1 scaling its not hard to get over the jumps. The fast guys will separate themselves by how hard they can scrub, and the 450 or factory 250 riders can hit a couple bigger sends that the smaller bikes will have to check up and double. The track layout is true to life with the exception of being widened and scaled up a bit to work better in game. I’ve also added roughness in specific areas and more ruts in the corners in an attempt to eliminate any OP lines and give more useable options during a race. The goal with this build was to replicate the feeling of riding a real life, not perfectly maintained amateur training track. The track was tested on all bikes from the 125s to the 450s and it’s a lot of fun on all of them, becoming more technical the further to the inside you go and the more CCs you roll off the virtual trailer.\nThe pit bike track isn’t supercross style like you often see but is essentially a worn-down kids motocross track. There are no real designated doubles or triples it just feels more like a neglected kids learning track. I wasn’t planning on making it raceable, but… I tend to get carried away. I’ve found it to be the most fun on the 4t pit bike and cant imagine the chaos with a full gate, but good luck.\nThe trails are about a 3 minute loop and are a lot of fun on all bikes but especially the enduro bikes. The trees bite, so bring your hand guards. A full gate through these trails could be… interesting.\nI have to give a huge shout out to everyone that helped me get the track to a state I was satisfied with releasing.\nObjects: Endo, Earthwurx, Red Rider, Fluffy gecko, Cody James, Kellz, Para Moto, GioPanda, and Typical Canadian for the custom shed/deck\nTutorials: TFC, Resolute Kraken, Jesse Mulock, Niko Mouk.\nTrack Testers: Skilz, Jenkins, Tempo, Sinfulishy, New Guy, Frosty, Typical Canadian, Steeler, Dylan Frisch, Red Rider, Arsenic, Dblu, Ryan Cardno, Calum.\nThanks to iNsane for all he does for the community, and the .pkz locker. Resolute Kraken for his amazing track builder and PiBoSo for the game.\nIf I forgot to mention anyone I’m sorry, there’s so many of you and my brain is mush.\nAnd an extra special thanks to Frosty, Typical Canadian, Jesse Mulock, Red Rider, Baked Minotaurs, Kruegs, Endo, and the EarthWurx discord for putting up with my constant questions, my usually self-caused issues, and taking the time to help me get this completed.  I would have given up on this a long time ago if it wasn’t for you.\nServer layout names for Dedi hosts:\nMotocross track- leave blank\nPit Bike track – PB\nTrails – Trails\nEnjoy!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nPoor Boyz Mx\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 33198\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nTrack link\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/lm8j3YwZ#tsIG03XL6hpSsaUSh6vAiQ7aKOe-IbdhCMbM7Lo9Vw0\nDefault\nLOW RES\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/l6lGFahZ#EXvSsor9Znqx6HGvoE1QfUR6hQx6WxLjJN7IF4_i2QM\nDefault\nSERVER version\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/Mv0UnA4Y#Ow-W3Qh4hFmXWQvLKGQMQ8QM1vT8C2SL5kFQ9xvWgqQ\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

But even if it is “easy” to ride, it isn’t a sweet task to be the fastest guy around because it has its own challenges. It’s almost wide-open track with elevations and big jumps to send nasty whips.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHey guys, this project came about mainly because I wasn’t happy at all with the originial Malvern I made. Lucky enough for me, they change their layout up a little each year, and this year the layout utilizes a little more of the terrain and elevation of the property. If you’re not familiar with the track, it is a local track here in east-central Ohio that regularly holds a series of night races (and the occasional day race). If you have played the older track, this one should feel quite a bit different. Textures, heightmap, objects, layout, everything is new and updated, as well as the scaling and map size are bigger to accomodate mxb physics. The track is a little on the darker side as I was going for a early evening sort of vibe.\nA couple things: a huge thank you to Superjoint for helping me get the LiDAR data and animated flags in game, as well as helping me test and providing feedback and some vehicles to use. Some other assets I used were provided by Giopanda (markers, toilets, tents), TFC (water truck that has been re-textured), Agitato (parts of his banner pack), Red (tents), RK (trackbuilder) FredMX (skidsteer). There is some flickering with some of the banners at a distance but stops when closer up. I tried everything to get it to stop but unfortunately couldn’t. The track has 30 gates (unfortuntately, I tried to squeeze 40 but couldn’t), and 40 pits.\nIf you have any interest in what the actual track looks like, here is great GoPro video from Jeff Holub during one of Malvern’s summer night races from this year with the updated 23′ layout:\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\n2023 Malvern\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 3017\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/pn5UWQ5A#pOkT6rbhv5c10yb5i-TJ-2a_GtzmaXYOJxu43lCbFGU\nServer Version\nServer\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/lmQAVRTL#263gkC0kXb2EbqAvaOAVJQWL5RCGiDewF6elYtCr41I\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

I have built MMX Main in the past so I decided I would throw the MMXX Sand on this release, giving you all two new tracks to race and battle on. The Main focus of the track was E-Street. As you get on the track if you have rode there you will notice it’s rougher than a normal practice day. I’ve made this pretty rough and with alot of line to choose from to create the best racing expeirence possible for each skill level. The MMX Sand being the easier of the two tracks is still a ton of fun to just hold it wide and battle with your friends….Also down the road I plan on recreating both of these with current layouts from 2023 as well.\nHope you all enjoy all the hardwork and man hours put into this by not only me, but everyone involved.\nFeatures\n⦁ 40 Rider Gate and Pits(Both Tracks)\n⦁ 2 Raceable Race Tracks (E-Street/ MMX Sand)\n⦁ Track cams for E-Street MX\n⦁ E-Street 2018 Layout\n⦁ MMX 2018 Layout\nSpecial Thanks\n⦁ RedRider197 for Starting Gates, Water Truck, EZ-Ups, Bleachers, and for answering my many questions.\n⦁ Each and everyone in the Earthwurx Discord have been nothing but helpful to me.

I built it for myself first, I wanted a spot where I could just run laps after laps and improve my skills without behing bored. I hope you will like to run hotlaps after hotlaps as much as I do.\nDespite the insane amount of work i’ve putted into this one, I decided to release it for free for the only reason of seeing it flood the servers. I want everyone to enjoy this one, and I hope it’s not too hard for it to enter the Tracks Hall of Fame…!! 😛\nNow a few words about the track itself. It is a pretty technical supercross track slapped on a motocross layout with elevation. It is really fun and flowy but it’s also pretty hard and techy. You gotta take your time to learn your way around this unique features. You can race it with your friends but it has been made mostly for solo training. Just do laps, let the deformation do it’s thing and enjoy while seeing your skills go STONK.\nThanks to RedRider and D.Alves for some of the objects !!\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nStoneysBackyard\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 25563\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nHazy Hills\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1_3wJaWkJ30-yuWIIJ3X-YFx1zvTlu0cd/view?usp=sharing\nServer Version\nSERVER VERSION\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1C4YwqNxaOCtyNaHA0fVinqU_2kFMpIMg/view?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\nStoneRider!\nLet's keep the good stuff raining !!\nBuy me a coffee!",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nSo after this Track being on my PC for about 6 months and not touching it for months. I have finally decided to finish it up and release it for hopefully everyone to enjoy. This Track is very heavily inspired by a local track here in Maine called Hemonds MX and Offroad.\nHowever it is in no way a replica\n, as I have changed things and added features for a more fun flowy aspect. This is The sawmill track, there are 2 tracks on the property but I sorta got busy with other projects and IRL things and never finished the second track. Eventually down the road I will probably rebuild The second one completely and finish the track and update this. But for now I just want to take a break from this project and work on other things. This is my first Actual release of a track. Have been doing track building for some time but never released anything yet. There are things that I would have done differently on this and maybe will change if I decide to update it. Such as I can model A LOT better now and may have changed a few things etc. I and plenty of friends have had fun on this track so decided to release it to the public.\nI would suggest taking a few slow laps to understand the track a bit before throwing down heaters. There are a few sneaky tight corners and a few wall jumps that will throw you off at first. The track is fun and rides well on all bikes as well. I prefer the 250 myself but there are a few fast 450 lines. I also put 40 gates because why not, gotta have some chaos sometimes.\nBig special thanks to\nTbell\nfor showing me everything track making wise the past 2 years. Without him I probably never would have known where to start.\nExtra credit to,\nMoto237- Being the main track tester since this build has started and constantly giving me feedback\nAll the boys on Satori for helping run test laps and races to get everything sorted\nCody James and Kellz- Trees\nRedRider- Gate asset\nAnd plenty of other friends over the past few months who have put feedback in on the track build\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nHemmonds MX.pkz\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 7181\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nRecommended\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/06p36fjolmhj08a/Hemmonds_MX.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Over the past 6 weeks or so this has been a passion project of mine to update this track and do it some justice. I have re-worked pretty much everything except for the base heightmap, which to my surprise was pretty good. Additionally, that track and link is being retired for this one.\nThings that have changed:\nAll textures (except for grass), including normal maps\nAll new objects, foliage, trees, watering pond, skydomes etc.\nAll new ruts and roughness, including added off-track berms on insides to try and stop cuts\nThere are 2 different skydomes for sunny, cloudy/rainy environments, including added wet textures for rainy conditions\nTiming gates, cameras, etc.\nAdditional gates (40) and additional pits (45)\nI would also like to say thank you to those that helped or have provided free objects to use, including Red (water truck, tents), FredMX (skidsteer), and Superjoint for vehicles, and overall thoughts and opinions.\nPS: If you ever been to OIR on a Sunday for open practice, then you’ve most certainly had your picture taken by Rich (mxfreakspix) who provides some great pictures for free because he loves to do it.\nTrack Info\nTrack ID:\nOIR Remastered.pkz\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4599\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nRecommended\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/J3JkGRrA#j50lJbaBdmwS1sjwG54XPkqWq7E8xSxM5bGnfOZ_WvU\nServer Version\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/A3o2BT4S#zngePwZQl13CFdSDzj9vEdrTz6b7E8ZDFiNLBIx8Hvk\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Main track, Fmx Ramps and trails. Trails are not timed, if you want them timed let me know and ill update it.\nI spent many hours building this track and I do my best to deliver “Quality” every time. I’m still learning new building processes along the way and will continue to progress for the MxBikes community. Like it, don’t like it, whatever, it’s a fun free track.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nSo after having made a couple replica tracks, I decided to try my hand at a “fantasy” track. I wanted to make something that was fast, had longer sweeping corners, and overall felt less congested than your typical local-cross track (lap times will be in the mid-2 minute range). This track also served as a testing site to try out some new techniques, as 99% of the track was built in Gimp. The track is not all that difficult; I added a moderate amount of roughness coming into most of the corners. Likewise, the track was tested using 1.6 – 2 erode, so it should handle more than that pretty easily. For OGs of the game, this isn’t anything new, groundbreaking, or exoctic. The textures and track features were influenced by many of the tracks I ride and visit in Ohio and Pennsylvania — meaning you’ve probably seen these types of textures 1,000 times. Nevertheless, I do feel the track is pretty fun and I have put a ton of time into testing it so hopefully you enjoy it. The insides are marked by Acerbis stakes and checkpoints are just to the outside of the stake, while corners that do not have stakes around the outside, the berm will serve as the outside of the corner. There is also a 40 rider gate, with 45 pits.\nA big thanks to those who have provided assets for the community to use: Red (water & dump truck, tents, semi) Fred MX (skid steers), and Gio Panda (Acerbis stakes), RK (track builder), Agitato (Red Bull tent, spongebobs, 100% inflatable, track archway), I Shot Tupac (vans), all other assets were modeled by me.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 5877\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nRecommended\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/V6JRzI5a#LMBA__K9pyE3xenD3l7DjJdU74ER-jcy1Dz6X1FlVCg\nServer Version\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/p3RGXA7Y#3wSe83vsGHwtUEm6pjHmRqbRPadwGbxOQNufuq0kvlo\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The idea came about after seeing the oval in Diablo county. Originally I didn’t even bother starting, but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind until I finally relented and here we are! I used the namesake track as a base layout, in Indianola, Iowa (and made it bike friendly) seeing as this track raced with cars in all the media I saw, I added bigger berms and a jump to hopefully facilitate some intense over/under crossings. There’s also a bypass to the jump if you don’t have the speed to clear it (though you risk colliding with bikes coming the other way!) This is a fairly small track overall, despite the speeds. Measuring at a total of 340 meters, a quick lap time for me (riding a cr250) was 15.8-16 seconds. Track has a total of 28 pit stalls/start gates, so get your friends together!\nMany thanks are in order, again:\nTFC, for the tutorials (This map wouldn’t exist without your videos!)\nAgitato, Giopanda, Rosshell, and Redrider197, for their trackside obects and arches\nResolute Kracken, for the wonderful track builder helper\nThank you all!

A while ago, a bunch of track creators did a 4 hour track build competition hosted by the man himself, Lynds. This was my entry into the competition where I ended up coming in second behind one of the best to ever do it: ENDO. I never released it because I didn’t feel like it needed to be released. Tbh, nothing has changed, I don’t think this is worth releasing, but I have been away from MXB for a solid 4 months and I miss it, and I really just want to share my 4 hours of mind numbing work that would’ve went unplayed forever (which it probably should, but whatever).

(go check it out if you want a\nproper replica of this track\n) So in the interest of bringing something fresh, I took the liberties to use the same overall layout (track path, elevation should still be close ish on track at least) and to bring my own creative flair to the features, roughness, and textures! I don’t really know what to label it as, seeing how its half replica – half fantasy.\nMost of my testing was done on a four stroke 250, with 3-5x erode (I love how this track erodes, the thumbnail is after 10ish laps on 5x erode) 125s shouldn’t have too much of an issue handling the track, 450s feel a bit overkill to me.\nI hope you enjoy your time spinning laps here!

This is a fantasy track that was created off the top of my head. It was unplanned, and I kind of winged it. I wanted to go for the backyard moto track vibe with a fun flowy track.\nIts not perfect, but hey, I tried. There are some nice booters, including a massive table and a Laroccos Leap style triple step up, both 4th gear wfo on a 250f. The track is mainly wide open and fast, but there are some technical aspects as well. I feel like there is a pretty decent skill gap, where beginners and more advanced players can both enjoy.\n40 gates & pits, ready for you to shred.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHello Everyone,\nAfter 10 tracks created, this one was a lot of fun to make. Inspiration was simple, build an all-sand track that races well. While sand is not 100% perfect in game, I hope you like the track. This was truly a collaborative project with help from the mx community for testing, tips, and assets. Thank you all for your contributions on this project as this is what made it so fun to build.\nLocated in somewhere in the desert mountains is this fantasy track. The track has some roughness and ruts built-in, multiple lines, 40 rider gates, and a large triple uphill jump that will test 250f HP. Flow is key on this track and sometimes the slower line can produce big sections afterwards. There are numerous sections with rollers in and out of corners to help create different lines/timing.\nTrack perimeter is outlined by yellow tires, if you stay between them, you will not get cuts. If you do not, you’ll get a time penalty. Track has working Trackside and Pitlane camera’s along with Marshals. Collisions are active; Soft for the SpongeBob’s, Hard for the perimeter fencing.\nCredits:\nReaperDoc – Testing and Video\nKahzey & TGR Team – Testing and Feedback\nENDO – Testing, textures, made a huge impact!\nEraaks213 – Testing\nResolute Kraken – Resolute Builder (Game Changer – Period)\nAgitato – Various Objects\nGioPanda – Various Objects\nRed Rider – Equipment & Gate Assets, texturing help\nTFC – Tutorials, Water Truck\nCody & Kellz – Tree asset (used for desert trees/bushes)\nRosshell – Pitlane Asset\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 2522\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nMEDIAFIRE - RIDER VERSION\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/yqz4rut4bd220hk/Desert+Sands+Raceway.pkz/file\nServer Version\nMEDIAFIRE - SERVER VERSION\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/3eciqvv12pa1saj/Desert+Sands+Raceway.pkz/file\nDefault\nMEGA - RIDER VERSION\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/w4VQUDKZ#KcUr6o7itryid1sNwZzQsotixBXXL-xok_XnAlcSWb8\nServer Version\nMEGA - SERVER VERSION\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/pk8iAI5L#ejKTuMdNYXGbsBxTlZmBBEctVoTUYtG4ccYGs2DcCRw\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\neraaks212!\nIf you like my content please consider donating but please know it is not required.

Malvern is your typical local Ohio motocross track with a little bit of elevation, some fast sections, as well as some tight off-camber sections. It’s been home to numerous Loretta’s qualifiers and has been a staple of the Ohio mx scene for years. The layout is mostly from the 2022 season, with the 2021 connecting straight back on to the finish (I just preferred it). The finish line triple is quite large and easily doable on a 450; however, on a 250f you’ll need to pretty much grease the corner before to get it.\nA big thanks to those who have provided assets for the community to use: Ruubs (trees), TFC (water truck), Phantomz and Fred MX (skid steers), and Gio Panda (banners, Acerbis stakes, tents), Ryan Cardno (garages), Cody James (stands), Noxo (tents), RK (track builder), Red (semi), as well as Jeff Holub who provided the GoPro I heavliy relied on to build and shape the track. I doubt Jeff plays MXB and will ever see this, but if he does, thanks! The GoPro can be found below if anyone is interested in what the real-life track looks like:\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 642\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/tr4rwgjbqz84egu/Malvern.pkz/file\nDefault\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/0zIXxY4A#UyzDsvhmDcG4uBJIbpZBNcEcpLWNYVtUwsNtH_sxohM\nServer Version\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/0zIXxY4A#UyzDsvhmDcG4uBJIbpZBNcEcpLWNYVtUwsNtH_sxohM\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The track itself is\nhard  packed\n(\nnow soft soil\n) with limited berms but features rough sections throughout. I also added a\nrevamped\nSX track where the 50cc track would be to play around on. Hope you enjoy the track!\nMake sure to delete the old PKZ\nfrom your track folder and replace with this updated version. You’ll find it under Midway MX 2023 in game.\nHuge thanks to the Mx Bikes community for help.

JS Robinson soon found a good 3D model of an aircraft carrier and he and I got to work trying to make this idea come to life. However, there was a big problem we had to find our way around. We couldn’t figure out how we were going to set up the heightmap so there wouldn’t be huge, ugly dirt walls covering the sides of the ship’s hull. So we moved onto other projects for the time being since we couldn’t really think of an answer at the time. Fast forward to late October, I learned how to animate objects, and when I animated water with moving waves I knew I had to make this idea work. I found out the solution to our problem was a lot simpler than we thought; just put the ship’s hull under the heightmap. This prevented me from being able to use the entire deck of the ship for the track, but I figured I’d find a way to make it all work. After a few months here it is, Top Deck. The answer to the question “What would a motocross event look like on an aircraft carrier?” I had a lot of fun and learned a lot making this project, and I hope you have half as much fun as I had making it 🙂\nDISCLAIMER: MAKE SURE THE WIND DIRECTION IS SET TO NORTH, OTHERWISE ANIMATED OBJECTS WILL NOT BE IN THEIR PROPER LOCATIONS\nI don’t know where to start with who to thank first for this project\nJS Robinson – Going halves on the ship model and testing\nBurrito – Track layout design, various ideas for the project, starring in release edit, and testing\nFatmuppet – Blender wizardry and early troubleshooting\nENDO – Textures and help with early troubleshooting, starring in release edit\nThe Stateline HRC Team – Being a great group of test riders, early troubleshooting from Razzles, MadcapDunker starring in the release edit, and being a great group to play the game with\nBrady, Sorru, TechnoPottzy – Testing, starring in the release edit\nEarthWurx – Always excelling as an amazing source of information for track building\nRedRider – Testing, texture help\nMouk Lab – Starting gate troubleshooting\nResolute Kraken – Making track building easy for dummies like myself with your great builder tool\nPiBoSo – Giving me the run down on how to animate objects, this track wouldn’t seem nearly as alive without it\nMost of all, you for checking out my track!

You can download the pit bike pack here:\nhttps://mxb-mods.com/ptibike-full-pack-include-2t_125cc-pittrack\nA lot of people seem to have issues downloading the pit bikes, all you need to do is replace your current ‘mods’ folder with the ‘mods’ folder in that pit bike pack, doing that will sort the folders accordingly. Do not place the pit bike ‘mods’ folder inside of your current one, just drag it into your window to replace it – you won’t lose any files. This method has worked every time for me and I had all my beta testers do the same.\nFrom there, place the track file into the ‘Pitbike’ folder under ‘tracks’, NOT your motocross/supercross/enduro etc.\nADDITIONAL TIPS FOR HANDLING THE 110s:\nCornering is the trickiest part on these bikes so avoid using your front brake, it’s super buggy and you will knife the front end – use the rear brake.\nSometimes leaning back when turning sharp will help keep the bike from knifing, other than that, don’t make such sharp turns on the 180 corners.\nYou will rarely need 3rd gear except for the start straight, you can hit some of the bigger lines at the top of 1st gear.\nYOU CAN DOWNLOAD MY UPDATED\nRESHADE PRESET\nHERE:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1C3jTLacYxl6DA7TaDOlriSXwwNC4ETvH/view?usp=sharing\nThanks to the guys in Pelster’s Den for helping me with beta tests\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 6906\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nMEGA\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/oEwTyYqY#ev1haKYKlpdBTvlyYNIpGJJtYwCahG9G-ezgSVX0Zhg\nServer Version\nMEGA\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/pQgX3CqL#9jiWRpwSTfqYkvM2TK3Fqnz8eB6MnenCkRUIKFQAwq8\nDefault\nMEDIAFIRE\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/60r3ulazkai5g8n/THE_MOSHPIT.pkz/file\nServer Version\nMEDIAFIRE\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/ak21j4okgj2zidn/THE_MOSHPIT_-_Server_Version.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nUPDATE 2/18/23: This is it y’all. Finally wrapped up this project which has taken somewhere around 150 hours of my life. Hope everyone enjoys it. I was planning on releasing this in a few weeks because I just released 2 tracks this month, but the anticipation is killing me.\nI made some changes to the main track, nothing major. The woods loop has been completely redone, I tried to make it more flowy and such. The centerline on the track isn’t too strict, as I wanted to keep the feel of it not being too regulated. Some tighter sections where you can almost double around corners are where you’ll find it being stricter because I didn’t want people just cutting the track. Lap times for me (I’m pretty buns at the game) were around 3:10-3:15 which I can imagine some of the better players coming in sub 3 minutes. I’m not sure what track in the game has the longest lap times, but this has to come close.\nI still plan on adding to the compound, you’ll notice an unfinished track off in the distance. So more updates will come. Thank you to everyone for the kind words when I released the WIP version. Especially Lynds, Troyjann, & Ianmx. Don’t know how much further I would’ve gotten if it weren’t for that.\nFor some reason, it won’t let me add updated pictures to the post\nThanks to:\nTFC- Skies & track tutorials\nCody- Beautiful trees pack\nEveryone in Discord that helps answer my questions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHey everyone, hope yall are having a good day. This is my very first attempt at creating a compound/track. Very early stages but wanted to get this out and share with you this little gnarly piece of Florida.\nThis is a Florida sand track. If any of you Florida boys know ex-pro Mike Picone, this is his practice track. It’s basically built in a huge sand pit. Super rough and gnarly. I grew up riding this track and felt the need to replicate it. It’s not an exact replica, but its probably close to 85%.\nThe track contains a full blown sand track, a turn track(unfinished), and a woods loop(unfinished). I will eventually be adding in a free-ride area with some floaters and then possibly an arenacross & supercross track.\nNo objects or centerline yet, still have a lot of work to do.\nHuge thank you to TFC & Resolute Kraken for their track tutorial series, Snappe for all the track creation files\nI’m really happy how the track has turned out so far, and am excited to get this project wrapped up\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 319\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/cHsVGKAQ#eWaodBKXPdeETcQw_5Q8QautxfxvF3OGXpMZQ4Bwnyw\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Back again with another Florida track. This is Reddick Motocross, or Motocross of Marion County.\nIf you raced in Florida within the last 15 years then you should know this track really well. Reddick hosted the Gold Cup series, Winter Ams, Florida Series and many other series throughout the years. Unfortunately people have to be jerks and complain about noise, so the track is shut down. This track was arguably the best track in Florida for many years. I just want to keep the memory alive by bringing the track into MX Bikes.\nThese tracks break down super nicely imo so putting deform between 1-2 seems to be perfect, allows breaking bumps to form better & ruts as well\nThere are 2 versions of this track, the main motocross version and the small supercross version. The sx track is ok, I didnt spend as much time on it as the main track, but you should still find some enjoyment out of it.\nAlso, I didn’t reinstall my reshade since I got a new pc so if the track textures are too bright try turning off reshade\nTo install them, open the zipped file & drag both the reddickmx.pkz & reddickSx.pkz into your track folder\nI want to take the time to thank;\nTFC- tutorials, track assets (water truck, skies)\nRyan – Garage Pack\nPhantomz – Skid Steer\nGiopanda – Track Assets (track markers, tent)\nCody – Trees pack (THE REAL MVP HERE)\nEveryone on discord, Typical Canadian, Jesse Mulock, Ruubs, Red, everyone. Without the help from y’all none of this would be possible\nIf I forgot to thank anyone, I am so sorry. Please call me out so I can adjust the post\nAny issues please let me know and I will work on fixing it.

This is my first track in MXB and was meant to be a realism backyard SX track somewhere in the mountains. The track layout and scaling is tricky and definitely leans more towards pro level. The textures are meant to be realistic and erode adds more detail to the track surface so don’t be scared to crank it to 5x + erode. I hope you guys enjoy and feel free to provide any feedback – There will be more to come!\nAdditionally Whoever posts the fastest time in video format to discord\nhere\nwill be immortalized on the record board for the next track release. You will also get an early link to the next track to set a new time for the board. There is no set deadline as it relies on when the next track is ready for release.\nCurrently Hurlz holds the fastest lap with a 1:03.0.\nI want to give a big shoutout to\nResoluteKraken\nfor helping me through the various troubles along the way.\nHemi\nfor helping me test the various scaling and layouts during the build.\nHurren\nand\nStoneRider\nfor advice and helping with tackling an MXB track for the first time.\nPhantomZ\nfor the skid steer model and\nAgitato\nfor the track marker model.\nDonations are obviously not required but if you’d like to buy me a coffee, here is my link.\npaypal.me/adehaven56\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 3248\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nHigh Quality\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/pyjp4sx2gv88xcw/Inz_SX.pkz/file\nServer Version\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/q38qe6i267psjit/Inz_SX_server.pkz/file\nHigh Quality\ndropbox.com\nDownload from dropbox.com\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/kb9ptnxbovr9hqk/Inz%20SX.pkz?dl=0\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/s/kb9ptnxbovr9hqk/Inz%20SX.pkz?dl=0\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Welcome to KI Tracks, a semi-replica of a classic midwestern track which sadly closed its doors in 2018. This compound features a main track, 2 sand tracks, a pitbike track, “pp track”, circle rut, figure 8 rut, and a trail loop that tours the entire facility! The only raceable track is the main track with 24 gates, but 40 pits to have each track populated in the same server. This is more than likely my last track release, and it’s been a ton of fun making tracks for you guys and seeing people enjoy my tracks. It makes me so happy to see people recognize my growth in track building. I can’t wait to rip it up with you guys, thanks for letting me share my creative outlet with you all.\nKeep a look out for easter eggs, they’re everywhere!!!\nThere are so many people that I credit with helping me out with this track.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHey guys, while stuck in Ohio I worked on another classic track found only in…Ohio. Briarcliff is a well-known Ohio track that has been home to numerous Loretta Lynn’s qualifiers. While I live a couple hours from Briarcliff, I’ve never actually been there. So with that being said, I relied heavily on GoPro footage, Google Earth, and other images to recreate this replica. The track seems to go through regular changes so this is mostly the 2022 layout, with the ’21 roller section at the end being added (felt it was more interesting than just another double-double section). The start straight is at a bit of an angle in real life and I did my best to taper it off with the rest of the track for this replica. Overall, the track is shorter than OIR and can be tricky remembering the layout as there are a couple rollers/wall jumps that can catch you off guard, otherwise I feel the track flows really well once you get the layout down. I’ve also scaled the jumps up a bit just to work better with MXB physics.\nAlso, big thanks to those who have provided assets for the community to use: Ruubs (trees), TFC (water truck), Phantomz and Fred MX (skid steers), and Gio Panda (banners, Acerbis stakes, trees), Ryan Cardno (garages), Agitato MX (start board), Noxo (tents), RK (track builder). I also modeled a number of assets in Blender for this track, however, it was only my second time using Blender so [please keep that in mind. I did try my best. As you’re reading this, I am probably already at work on another classic Ohio regional qualifier: Malvern MX ’22.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 621\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/0dkcsth8d2j5pc4/Briarcliff.pkz/file\nServer Version\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/q8imwass725muap/Briarcliff_Server.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Wavy again, with yet another track release!\nStoned MX is a track based on the property of a grow OP. Based in a secluded desert area somewhere in the world (Use your imagination.)\nStoned MX is a Intermediate/Pro Track. I say pro, because the roller sections are relatively hard. Passing in the roller sections is so satisfying! Every section of this track is possible, it just requires very finesse stick movements. I tried to make this track have a lot more lines than my first one. I’m still learning and will continue to learn. At least the track isn’t flat this time! I tried to use more of the map to make different levels of height to refrain from using the Wall of Trees. Let me know what you think! Any kind of feedback is greatly appreciated! Also the Skybox will be different than what you’re seeing in the videos. The recordings were made during track development.\nOnce again, thank you everybody for the track assets! They are such a huge help for beginners!\nLeave a comment on this post, and tell me why you think there are so many roller sections on this track!? 😉\nI also recommend the shader presets from the Netherlands MXGP track! It really makes this track POP!\nP.S.\nThe song used in the track preview is actually me. I’m an artist as well, I’ve been taking a break and chilling out for the holidays learning some new and different stuff. let me know what you think of it! I have added 2 different versions of the track. One with The song at the starting line and one without. Your choice!\n!!!!! IF YOU WANT TO RECORD THIS TRACK FOR YOUTUBE, DONT WORRY ABOUT COPYRIGHT, I OWN ALL RIGHTS TO THE SONG. YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO USE IT !!!!!!\nP.S.+\nThere are freeride lines scattered through the track for you freestyle/bike life people!\nI just gave up on the banners. I know some of them are in the ground, but I kept having to redo them. Not very many spots, but just ignore the spots that do 🙂\nThis is the track after final touches 🙂 The background has been Color Changed, so it ties in with the track!\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 200\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nStoned MX Version Select\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HgjDUKbHgfA6FOw9Ka9QB9MnbsMYgtLn?usp=share_link\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The JGR MX Race team has trained at this location from 2007 until 2020.\nThis facility featured 2 supercross tracks and an outdoor national track, I decided to put in a Vegas style track in place of their smaller supercross track. Also added is a trail with some enduro stuff on it, I figured why not, let me know if there’s any problems with those objects. There are a lot of trees, I started out with 5000, then dropped it to about 750, I tested it on a laptop with a 1060 and was getting between 60-90 fps, and 160-200fps on my 2080ti. If there are enough complaints about low frames ill drop the tree count.\nI hope you guys enjoy as this is my second released track, people seemed to like Goat Farm so maybe you’ll like this.\nROSSHELL\n– for track assets\nAGITATO\n– for track assets and some tutorial videos\nREDRIDER197\n– for semi pack track assets\nTFC\n– for video tutorials and track assets from the forum –\nThe Assets Thread (mx-bikes.com)\nRESOLUTE KRAKEN\n– for the track builder, video tutorials, and for making it possible for any pleb like me to contribute to this awesome community\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1133\nMade for\nBeta 18\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/1semcm6pf8xxls6/JGR_MX_Testing_Facility.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Sorry for that.\nWhat did change:\nChanged heightmap resolution from 4k to 2k\nScaled down track, skymap and objects’s textures to 1K or less\nScaled down and merged track masks when possible\nRemoved all collision except some few exception\nRemoved some useless 3d objects\nI also took the opportunity to make other changes which are not related to performance\nChanged track id to\n2019.mxgp.imola.ros\nto be compliant with the standard (Thx Niko, this time I have watched your video with more attention)\nOrientation of the sun has been modified according to the skymap, so the track textures can looks different but that’s only due to shadow orientation which has changed\nDue to the scale down of the heightmap the track looks a little bit less detailed but I think it remains acceptable.\nThere are now an additional “minimalist” version, which contains less 3d objects, in case you still have issue with FPS. But I hope the standard version should now run smoothly (not less than 100 FPS) for almost everyone. The new size of the track is now 453 Mo, instead of 950 Mo previously so it’s more than 50% less size and I think the quality is still acceptable, but I’ll let you judge about that.\nLet me know in the comments if you still having any issue. I really hope everyone will be able to enjoy this track now.\nThe download links have been updated with the new versions.\nHello Everyone,\nHere is my second track, a replica of MXGP of Imola 2019.\nI spent a lot of time on it and tried to improve the quality compared to my first map Faenza 2020. Some new assets have been created especially for this track, they will also be released soon on MxbMods.\nThis track contains a lot of 3d objects and some high resolution textures, so you may need to reduce quality in the graphical settings for having better fluidity. It’s also heavy, almost 1Go (but already reduced by 400Mo by usig DDS textures instead of TGA).\nIt’s actually running on 8yr old computer, with GTX 970 graphic card, so I guess it should be ok on almost all configurations.\nI hope you will enjoy it and have some good rides on it !\nLet me know your feedback in the comments\nBig Thanks to:\nAgitato\nfor the assets and templates.\nAlbuquerque\nfor the assets, advices, testing.\nTFC\n,\nNiko Mouk,\nGioPanda\n,\nPhantomz\n,\nRedRider197\nfor their tutorials and assets\nResolute\nfor the amazing Track Builder Helper\nHurrenMX\n,\nJV\n,\nRuubs\n,\nInsane\nfor the help on Discord\nAlpha\n,\nL21\n,\nMulock22\nand\nBishop\nfor testing\nAnyone I could have forgot\nIf you like my work you can\nbuy me a beer\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 5881\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nCompatible with other Betas.\nDefault\nTrack download (453 Mo)\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/1ivvbp51fh5k4q1/MXGP_of_Imola_2019.pkz/file\nLow Quality\nMinimalist version (330 Mo)\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/783lm3qv0xspqz2/MXGP_of_Imola_2019.pkz/file\nServer Version\nServer version (8 Mo)\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/dhdyw0xtw1b9ysc/MXGP_of_Imola_2019.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The purpose of this track is for us looking forward to the 2023 SX season to begin to have a map to train on. This is in NO way trying to replace the “Ride the Track Map” series. It’s for fun to have Rounds 10-17 on ONE MAP.\nImportant information:\nONLY ROUND 13 has live timing.\nThere is 40 gates/pits only so that we can have many people on the map at once. There is 40 gates (2 sets of 20) on Round 13 track.\nAll Rounds can be ridden on 250’s & 450’s.\nThere is camera’s, mostly around Round 13\nThere is working marshal’s\nThere will be limited objects/texture features. I did add non-collidable tuff blocks to Round 13. It is what it is everyone. Have fun!\nWant to support me? How about getting a track in return too? If you haven’t downloaded my 212 Moto Ranch yet you can support me on the MX Bikes Shop.\nhttps://www.mxbikes-shop.com/downloads/212-moto-ranch/\n.\nI won’t be doing timing for all 8 rounds. Unless there is overwhelming support from the community to want more.

The purpose of this track is for us looking forward to the 2023 SX season to begin to have a map to train on. This is in NO way trying to replace the “Ride the Track Map” series. It’s for fun to have Rounds 1-7, 9 on ONE MAP.\nImportant information:\nONLY ROUND 3 has live timing.\nThere is 40 gates/pits only so that we can have many people on the map at once. There is 40 gates (2 sets of 20) on Round 3 track.\nRounds 1-5 are built scaled for 450’s. The triples are massive\nRounds 6, 7, 9 can be ridden on 250’s & 450’s.\nThere is no camera’s\nThere is no working marshal’s (They might be on track 1!)\nThere will be limited objects/texture features. It is what it is everyone. Have fun!\nWant to support me? How about getting a track in return too? If you haven’t downloaded my 212 Moto Ranch yet you can support me on the MX Bikes Shop.\nhttps://www.mxbikes-shop.com/downloads/212-moto-ranch/\n.\nI won’t be doing timing for all 8 rounds. Unless there is overwhelming support from the community to want more.

Snake Creek was my way of learning the process of making tracks in general, and this was a learning process focused on what I can do in blender and track files to make as detailed of a map I could make in 2-3 weeks time.\nThere is something for truly everyone, from those just starting freeride, to seasoned veterans of this side of MXB. This was mainly made using the 250f for testing, but there are a couple jumps more aimed towards the 450’s.\nJust like last time, I don’t even know who to thank first.\nFatmuppeT for your blender/ track animation knowledge and help with just about everything in general.\nHiggo for assets, being a good tester and positive motivator.\nENDO for textures, various blender knowledge, and testing.\nThe EarthWurx discord for being my library of references, assets, and everything else track building.

AK Farms was a popular local cross track in New York state that closed down circa 2015.  This rendition was created from 2013 lidar data with several sections reimagined for MX Bikes. There are 40 gates (2 rows of 20/ea), which should make for some chaotic fun. All feedback is welcome and will be utilized if an update is needed.  Hope you enjoy!\nShout out to Heatwave, SmokinJo & nike23 for play testing and lot’s of constructive criticism during the build process\n.  Also want to give credit to Ruubs & Resolute Kraken for quickly responding to my noob questions on Discord.

It has been a while since my last track upload (Compound 30), so I wanted to share/give back to the community by releasing this track for free. This project was a 2 week build that was inspired by a real track, located in Andover, Ohio, called NEMX (shut down in 2013). I changed the outdoor scenery/environment to give it a fantasy track feel, which I thought would be better for the game. Glacial Gears was intended for all skill levels. I didn’t make the tough blocks have collisions, for newer riders to try and learn Arenacross/Supercross without having to be punished for every mistake, as well as trying to keep the rhythm sections tame, yet do-able for new comers. Don’t be fooled though, there are PLENTY of big lines for pro players. Each rhythm section has 2-3 rhythm lines that are pretty equal in speed.\nI really hope you guys enjoy this one! I can’t wait to show you some other bigger projects that I have in the works. Cheers! – Spuds30\nSpecial Thanks!\n–\nEndo Creations\n– This dude is basically my professor. He puts up with the thousands of questions I ask him while trying to improve as a creator, as well as providing some of the best laughs while doing it. He’s provided me with a ton of textures/objects as well. Enjoy your track building retirement bro!

It is a replica of Competitive Edge MX in 2009. I used to work there as a equipment operator and flagger for about 2 years. The track not quite 1:1 but close enough for the fun factor.\nThis is one of many layouts we had during 2009-2010, IF you rode there when it was in a different layout I will consider making additional layouts after I 100% complete this layout first so please don’t tell me my layout is wrong this is the one I am using because I am the most familiar with this one. I tested this in VR so some of the ruts may be small in some corners(VR makes it easier to hit them).\n-Known Issues\nCenter Line may be a little offf\nBlack abyss surrounds the track(has no effect on the track its self just dont ride off the edge of the map)\nTrack file has 2011 instead of 2009 in it so dont be alarmed when you unzip and the year is different\nNo Cameras positions have been added\nThe models I created ie Tower and Hay bales are just place holders so are the default track textures\nCredits\nGiopanda for the Asset pack\nTFC for the Water Trucks\nPhantomz for the Skid steer\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 283\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nDefault\nCompetitive Edge 2009\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/3v16c0nf184uhax/Competitive+Edge+2011.7z/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The name Somerset comes from the town Somerset, PA. I drove past Somerset on the Pennsylvania turnpike when I’d make trips home to visit my family while I was serving in the military, and the landscape was amazing. So I decided to make a track that I could imagine being in the valleys of Somerset.\nMy main focus when creating this track was on flow. I wanted multiple lines, some sneaky jump lines, and technical sections that will make or break a lap time. I originally  had a rougher version but found that the track worked better with alittle less roughness, allowing you and your buddies to make some lines of your own!\nA\nHUGE\nthank you to everyone who helped make this possible!\nEndo Creations\n– Nearly all my objects, and tons of tips and tricks to help me complete my vision.\nSpuds 30\n– For also being a massive help with the administrative things, as well as testing in the early phases.\nShadey Wadey\n– for some tips on administrative contingencies  and just being a homie hypinh up the build.\nHiggo\n– For the Tents (sorry I lost some textures..)\nFat Muppet\n– For track texturing tips and tricks\nStateline HRC Honda team\n– For tons of testing and feedback on what I should and should not change.\n– Madcap, Hunt, Hatter, Undefined, OG Soul Rider, KJMaury, Eyeballs, Vibin\nENJOY! ~ Razzles 126\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4764\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/vxztm0qe98aj8ge/Somerset_Valley_MX.rar/file\nServer Version\nServer Version!

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHey peeps!\nToday I’m finally able to bring you Redwick!\nThis is a project I started at the beginning of the new year. As some of you may know, I built tracks for MVA Reflex (modding community) and Redwick was a fantasy track I built/released in late 2020. This version of Redwick has changed a fair amount due to MXB physics but I believe this to be the best version of Redwick and I’m in love with how it turned out. That said, the track difficulty is most likely intermediate to advanced. Take some time to learn the track and the sections and eventually it will feel very flowy.\nI have a lot of people to thank for all the support and questions I had during this new track making endeavor. I’ll be honest, I knew I needed something new but I didn’t know if I would be able to do it or be successful at it. I’m glad I made the move though and I’m here to stay.

There have simply been so many people helping me its hard to keep track of everyone <3\nI tried to make this track as much as of a replica as I could. From what I know there is only 1 line that James Stewart was doing in the long section that is not possible. But other than that you have a wide selection of lines.\n(Please dont launch the double into the whoops <3)\nFor the Server Version\nJust open the folder to find the PKZ. I put it in a folder so I could upload it to MediaFire since it has the same name as the normal version and would override it. 🙂\nThanks for dealing with my stupidity\nI expect no donations, but if you wanted to show me some love a simple follow on\ninsta\nor sub on\nyoutube\nwould do the trick!\nAnd you will get a sneak peak at my coming projects.\nEnjoy\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 535\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nDefault\nMediaFire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/nc7wna41k7yv5jb/2014+Toronto.pkz/file\nDefault\nMega\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/jhdTnI5T#6Is0Uvq0PtVppVzjRZGd68fOLTbHtmshubddotUliWk\nServer Version\nMediaFire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/kdewh47kl7k1564/Server+Version.zip/file\nServer Version\nMega\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/CoMknB6S#vYkLEsYUHRO2E_SpSkMIQwveMueSoxPMBuUFc9z_ZOU\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

I’m back with my 5th track release, and this one is special to me because it is my home track where I ride, race and coach other riders. Tampa Mx was my first ever track build last year. With how much this track means to me, I wanted to come back and do the track the best justice I could. This started out as a small project where I would just change around some textures and assets, but the more I would play around the hungrier I got for this project, and it turned into a full rebuild from the ground up. I have been working on this track for about 3 months now and I can finally say that I am proud to present this track to you guys. This track is pretty demanding on the PC, so I have included a potato version. If you are a content creator, I give you full permission to use my track for content, but please use the full version.\nThere have been many people who have helped and supported me through this process, so if I forget anyone, please forgive me.\nENDO\n– Textures\nC4\n– Berms\nMouklab\n– Tutorials\nResolute Kraken\n– Kraken Track Builder Tool and Turorials\nGiopanda\n– Assets\nTFC\n– Water Truck and Tutorials\nNAVO009\n– Vans\nKewinfeula\n– Assets\nMulock22_\n– Testing and General Help\nPixistix69\n– Testing\nLegalViewBot\n– Testing\nLogan\n– Texture Mask Help\nSpuds30\n– Testing\nAmbieOfficial\n– Logo and General Help/Emotional Support\niNsane\n– General Help\nCody James\n– Moral Support\nRed\n– Asset Help\nLogan\n– Hosting the most valuable Discord server this game has ever seen\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1817\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nHigh Quality\nFull Quality Track\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1JL64QbbNVZijsBq8hjRO0Y_ziC6Y4bYh/view?usp=sharing\nLow Quality\nPotato Version\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1PngylRCX31PPMsH4bowsY9bTVH_vhfLp/view?usp=sharing\nDefault\nSupport Me!\nDownload from paypal.me\nhttps://paypal.me/dylan44frisch?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

You wont be the first doing the track backwards (neither virtual nor analogue).\nYeah my uncle did it irl until my dad told him the right way 😉\nSo long for now, enjoy some pics in this post, then the track and then the summer weather!\nI will grab some holiday and will be back with new content for you guys at earliest two weeks!\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 25\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nDefault\nMEGA KEY: ?\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/dhtEyTYb\nRecommended\nfrom my Website\nDownload from tillben8.wixsite.com\nhttps://tillben8.wixsite.com/mxb-mods-by-tb8/mc-trebitz\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

I used some different techniques to build this track which is intended to be more like a national track. There should be some good roughness and ruts that are intended to provide options and difficulty. Lap times should be within the 2:38-2:48 timeframe for most riders. Track features 40 pits/gates, sand whoops, large booters, and numerous uphill/downhill sections. The track should be good for both 250 and 450 racing.\nBig thank you to the Mx Bikes community for help. Most notably TFC, Resolute Kraken, RedRider197, Agitatos, Giopanda, and Mouk Lab for the tutorials, tools, objects, and discord help.

There was a tight deadline to get this released for the series and it will continue to evolve for next year’s round 2 race as well.\nUPDATE: Made some revisions to the starting gates. Fixed the cuts on first lap completion.\nLink to the series is here:\nhttps://discord.gg/ta2Dtq2qev\nThe track itself has little elevation but does feature many big jumps and tricky sections including sand. There are multiple lines in many corners and should be good for racing. Many thanks to the JuicedOut Motosports team for all the testing put into the track.\nLastly, thank you to the track building community.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nSharing my 4th track for Mx Bikes. This replica track is of BCMX Adventure Park located in Cambridge, MN.  The track is soft soil and features many offset turns. I’ve recreated the track as-is with the exception of a couple sections where I’ve either added jumps to make it more enjoyable or made them doubles instead of tabletops.\nThere is rough and great deformation that you will notice after spinning a couple laps. I’ve made the options in the turns close to the same timing to create some racing opportunities. The berms won’t hold you if you blast them so you may need to use some technique. I had a great time building this track and hope to see some good racing online!\nThe track also includes a hybrid supercross track where the minibike track usually is as well. The trees have collisions as does the perimeter fence and flag stands, tents, spongebobs, and buildings.\nUPDATE: By popular demand I’ve changed the gates and pits to 40. Thank you to all the streamers filling their lobbies for races on BCMX.  Update your files by deleting the old and putting the new PKZ in your tracks folder. As always, remember to use your brakes in that first turn 😉\nLastly, huge thanks to the Mx Bikes community for help. Most notably TFC, Resolute Kraken, Agitatos, Giopanda, and Mouk Lab for the tutorials, tools, objects, and discord help. Thank you also to my test riders featured on the track signage.\nThank you all for the positive responses.

I have been on and off grinding since November, and I have been so excited to share it with you guys. I did want to do a solid amount more with it, but my girlfriend and I have just moved in, and with IRL racing and real life happening, I don’t have the time to put in as much as I did, however I am happy with where it is at. There is a main track, pro supercross track, ametuer supercross track (AX), and a free ride area. Everything in this facility IS 250-able, but with a sick setup and dumb amounts of runup depending on what it is, but it is definitely a 450/500 playground. It is a 40 man gate, and 40 man pits, so all your friends can come out and ride. Also, I am 100% aware of it being WFO. It is what my friends and I enjoy playing so it will resemble Sky Is The Limit a lot. Hope to see you guys out there!\nVeteran Mx is a program that I am a part of that is for US military members and veterans as a way to build a community around motocross. This is my tribute to them.\nThere are so many people to thank for everything in this track from just raw help, to assisting me and straight up making me assets, and I couldn’t do it without you guys.

This is my home track, away from home. I started this project back in July as a passion project. There was a lot of heat and drama going on when I started about the possibility and likeliness of the track closing. It was almost a guaranteed shut down going into September. Thankfully the clubs (OTMX and OTHG) and the city of Fernley were able to work out an agreement to keep the track open!\nFernley, Nevada is a little city about 40 miles east of Reno. Exit 48 (you’ll see the Walmart and Terrible’s Truck Stop). Left under the freeway. Left after the truck wash (if you hit the sand you’ve gone too far). Follow the road until you find the entrance at the next freeway underpass. The Sandbox has been around for decades with probably 100s of iterations, run by the two MX clubs who share the property; Nevada Old Timers MX and Over The Hill Gang – Reno chapter.\n{“Source” : “GeForce SHARE”, “B64” : “eyJEUlNBcHBOYW1lIiA6ICIiLCAiRFJTUHJvZmlsZU5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJTaG9ydE5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJDbXNJZCIgOiAwfQ==”}\nSo here is the compound\n. Contained are\nfour raceable tracks\n. Two MX. Two GP. And a ton of\nnot so hidden\neaster eggs. The 2012 Sandbox GP, 2013 East and West MX tracks, and 2015 Sandbox GP.\nFor all you bieklyfe wheelie wierdos, there are even roads to rip.\nGo adventure around and discover all the hidden tracks and trails!\nAll three weather options are flushed out with drastically different skies and ambiance.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nI never thought I’d say this, but here’s my first track! There was no better track to learn on than my favorite local track which definitely deserved to be put in a game much sooner. Many great memories here, guys like Gregg Duffy, Tyler Wozney, and a much younger Coty Schock would be found riding here regularly. This was just a practice track IRL, they apparently just built a start straight a couple weeks before I posted this, but I had no good way of seeing where they put it. So I just made use of the giant open field next to the track to make a pretty gnarly start that doesn’t fit the track at all but screw it, it’ll be fun for racing.\nVery fun IRL track and is fun to ride in game, yes it is narrow and yes you don’t have to be WFO over all the jumps, it’s a replica that I tried my best to make as fun as I could in the game. If that’s not for you remember I’m not forcing you to download this.\nAs for who to thank, I don’t even know where to begin.\nFatmuppeT for basically giving me a free $100 masterclass on blender and other misc. things with track files along with your banners.\nHiggo383 for the extra deluxe tents and testing, Coty James for the bench in the tents, Resolute Kraken for your super handy track building software and tutorials, JSRobinson for various assets, all around buildiing assistance and testing, and the entire EarthWurx crew for being such an amazing support group to learn from. You guys truly are the best.\nThe whole Stateline HRC team for being my test riders, Spuds30 for supplying with the Camper Vans, Razzles on some L3DT tips, and OG Soul Rider for never being afraid to hold back criticism.\nMouk Lab for centerline/TrackEd tutorials.\nGiopanda, AGMX, TFC for assets (I’m sure I missed someone I’m Sorry.)\nPanicRev, C-Walk62, MotoMiika, and TKO Smokey for testing.\nMost of all, YOU for checking out my track!

This compound has taken me quite a long time to complete and get it to a standard I’m okay with releasing. I could have went all out more than I did, but it’s a very large file due to 5 tracks being involved. I wanted to minimize the quality and quantity of objects being used, so that it’s PC friendly and everybody can play it, while keeping it aesthetically pleasing at the same time. This Compound contains a pro national caliber Motocross Track, 3 Supercross tracks, an Arenacross, as well as some FMX/Free Ride in the mix as well. This track was created prior to beta 17, but everything still works.\nThis compound is what I’d envision my dream compound to be, hence “Compound 30”. It was completely hand made from scratch and I couldn’t be happier with how it turned out. I originate from PA and the fall vibe along with the elevation changes is what inspired me for this build. 6 months in the making and it’s finally able to be shared with the community! I hope you guys enjoy it!! Please leave feedback so I can continue to grow as a track builder.

This circuit is suitable for all types of motorcycles. However, you will have to use a 450cc engine to land perfectly in the landings.\nNext to this circuit you will find a small freestyle area with a nice 7m high jump to test!\nThe track also has several small “easter eggs” that you can discover as you go along.\nI would like to thank Kraken for its excellent track creation software and TFC for its various tutorials.\nInstallation : Put the .PKZ file in your PiBoSo\\MX Bikes\\mods\\tracks\\motocross folder\nThis track took more than 60 hours of work!\nIf you are satisfied with this track and want to help me, you will find a small link below to make a donation which will allow me to buy a small beer at the bar of my village.\nPaypal link for donation : https://paypal.me/donmickael?country.x=FR&locale.x=fr_FR\nHave a good ride and gazzz!\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 192\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nRecommended\nDirect link (Mega.nz)\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/elZzDCAI#R6uadgFOEdSeQ8ndQJdQ9H4wCH5sFr4-79qCMfaG4XY\nOptional\nDirect link (Mega.nz)\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/elZzDCAI#R6uadgFOEdSeQ8ndQJdQ9H4wCH5sFr4-79qCMfaG4XY\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\n***fixed-people tripling up the hill, added braking bumps and altered the backside of the second double\n***fixed-frames issue by removing most of the semi’s, just know that made me sad\n*** dont forget to reset track to avoid texture issues!\n2011 Pala Raceway\nThe incredible fight that has been the 2011 Lucas Oil Motocross Championship\ncame to a close this weekend at Pala Raceway with the second annual\nPala National. In the 250 class, the Championship was wrapped up last week\nat Steel City with Dean Wilson being crowned the 2011 AMA Motocross\nChampion, but there was still the 450 Championship left to decide.\nMonster Energy/Kawasaki’s Ryan Villopoto and defending race and\nseries Champ, Rockstar/Makita/Suzuki’s Ryan Dungey, came to the finale separated\nby fourteen points, and the final two motos would decide who would be\nthe 2011 AMA 450 Motocross Champion.\nIn moto one, stress levels for the two Championship contenders would reach\ndangerous levels when they both rounded turn one outside of the top ten. With chaos\nall around, Dungey and Villopoto emerged at the end of lap run running ninth\nand tenth. With a comfortable fourteen point lead, Villopoto didn’t need to race\nwith Dungey, but to the surprise of everyone, the number two got into several\nexchanges with Dungey as the two moved forward through the pack. At one point while\nthey battled, Villopoto even nearly went down hard when his hand slipped off the\nbars in a very high speed section, but the three-time motocross Champ saved\nit and, soon after, passed Dungey.\nUp front, KTM’s Mike Alessi led the way early before being passed by Factory\nHonda’s Justin Barcia. Justin rode an incredible race in the lead, but before\nlong, the young 450 fill-in rider was under attack from the Championship contenders\nwho were in their own battle. The first through was RV2 quickly followed by Dungey.\nThe two ran away to finish one and two in moto one. With Villopoto’s moto win, he\nstretched his points lead to seventeen heading into the final moto of the year.\nHolding onto third in moto one was Justin Barcia followed in by the number 800 KTM\nof Mike Alessi, the Rockstar/Makita/Suzuki of Brett Metcalfe and BTO Sports/Suzuki\nof Kyle Regal in sixth. It was nice–after not racing most of the year–to see Regal’s\nSuzuki up near the top five. Riders in this sport often suffer from being “out of\nsite, out of mind,” so it was good that Kyle reminded us of his skills by lining\nup for the last few Nationals.\nWith seventeen points now separating the two Ryans in the Championship, all Villopoto\nhad to do was finish thirteenth to clinch the title. When the gate dropped, the two\ncontenders were once again together and buried in the middle of the pack. Villopoto\njumped in behind Dungey, but this time–instead of battling with the number one–he settled\nin right behind him. From there, Villopoto followed Dungey as they made their way through the pack.\nIn the lead early on in moto two was the former points leader, Two-Two Motorsports Chad Reed. In\nmoto one, Reedy had crashed in turn one, remounted dead last and came back to finish twelfth, so\nhe was looking for redemption in moto two. The Australian led the first six laps until a mistake\nlet Barcia around. Just a few laps later, the two Ryans went by as well. Reedy put up a heck of\na fight in 2011, but in the end, that mental edge he had early in the season seemed to melt away\nwith his Milleville crash. Reed still held on to finish a solid fourth in moto two and finished\nthird on the year in Championship points. Congrats to Reed on a career resurrecting 2011\nseason, and here’s to many more.\nAs moto two wore on, Dungey was looking for a little consolation for losing the Championship\nand to get that he needed to pass Barcia for the overall. When he first moved around Reed for\nsecond, Barcia was nine seconds ahead, but he went to work and, with two laps to go, was all\nover the number seventeen. Dungey worked on Barcia for one lap and, just before the white\nflag, grabbed the lead and went on to the moto win. With a 2-1 score on the day, Dungey was your\noverall winner. Barcia’s 3-2 left him third overall. But the big winner on the day was Ryan Villopoto.\nWith a 1-3 score on the day, Villopoto was second overall and, more importantly, was crowned the\n2011 AMA 450cc Motocross Champion for the first time in his career. Ryan has now won five AMA National\nChampionships and one Regional Lites SX crown in his young hall of fame career, and his 2011 450\nMotocross Championship has to be one of the sweetest. The three-time AMA Motocross Champion has spent\nthe last two motocross seasons on the couch watching, so to come back and win the 450 Championship has\nto be an incredible feeling. Put that on top of his 2011 450 Supercross Championship, and it’s been a\nyear full of incredible feelings.\nThanks to VerySadTaco for the feedback on the track\nSpecial thanks to\nTFC\nAGMX-Agitato\nNiko Mouk\nGiopanda\nandreawilson|photography\nDrag and drop 2011 Pala Raceway.pkz into tracks folder\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 2040\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nDefault\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/EU53EYhZ#rTR4S52LUMdeLeracyibx3Wa_SSXJXa4OxhYsIKERN0\nOptional\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/agoazx6f2ralc01/2011_Pala_Raceway.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Supercoop’s is a local Michigan sand track near me, it’s actually a practice facility and the real-life track doesn’t have a start gate, so I had to squeeze one in. This track is very simple but there is still a skill gap, if you know me you know I don’t enjoy making easy/beginner tracks, there are plenty already out, but it’s a great track for getting comfortable with roughness. The style of this track is actually inspired by MC Malente After Hours by Olsson32 on Reflex, a track that Tylyn, RedRider197, me, and a bunch of other close friends of ours would pull all-nighters on years ago, doing 30 lap races over and over just having some of the best times on, so I wanted to capture some of that in this track.\nYou can find the video from Tylyn’s channel here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsYBbSfhVcc\nTents and Porta-potty by GioPanda\nSpecial thanks to beta testers\nDonations are of course not required but if you’d like to compensate me, my link is\npaypal.me/brethurren\nCome join my track creating streams!:\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/hurrencanetv\nSubscribe to my MXB YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHGlGiMNgA0BSq9KoPY06Ww\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 2640\nMade for\nBeta 17\n.\nDefault\nMediaFire\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/r2wta9yc3ul9hkr/Supercoop_MX_-_Beta_17.zip/file\nDefault\nMEGA\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/5d4khAqb#zKKzwCepTxpe3GRgAdVwyHw6d0UK3MPYQxBedYR6umA\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Meadow Valley is also known as “Medical Valley” to the local rider scene because of the frequency of injuries here. The track in real life features no starting line but I made some revisions and inserted a start gate so races can occur in MxBikes. The track is rough, technical, and has some difficult narrow sections. If you are looking for wide, long, tall berms to rail all the way around the track wide open look elsewhere.\nThe track also includes a replica 2013 Minneapolis Supercross track that hosted the epic Dungey vs Villopoto battle. On the opposite side of the map is a couple freestyle ramps to enjoy. As always, leave your constructive feedback and rate the track.\nHave fun and enjoy!\nUpdated: Skybox issues fixed 2/1.\nLastly, huge thanks to the MxBikes community for help.

Welcome to Farley’s Facility!\nHere is a cool preview by the one and only bad boy Bryan Farley my G:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOyDc9km90w\n– Bryan Farley: “I do want to tell you, You completely exceeded my dream for a straight rhythm facility (I had faith in your talents by your previous work) something about multiple rhythm sections sounds cool but making it a reality and the community hasn’t seen a created map other than pibosos default I was worried more that it might not be what the community enjoy/will enjoy. I said screw it no risk no reward and hit you up far as layout it’s perfect first session was for like hours the 3 courses were great idk how you came up with them I literally enjoy all of them. I liked the big send into the oval & the house jump is great as well I could go on for days picking what I love about this facility because bro I LOVE it you are talented easy to work with and grateful for going through this process and I proudly feel you are a friend not just a content creator”\nFeulaTracks\nIf you are interested in making some track just dm me on my instagram @feulatracks @kewinfeula131 or my discord: kewinfeula#5028\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 2923\nDefault\nMain\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/ccERAKyT#MOwT8aFjzYz6QkWFja4U2M3G5us5DvA1HxAtnYGBINs\nDefault\nMiddle\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/5Ql2DBqL#ArVeccU31v2Lhr3vxF1J_LMJGtDZArAxEXvS_tH50ps\nDefault\nSand\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/pclyHZgD#tSIGOk7MMMVza9NJ10D4ahgoBedC3GNGuYLSUdWwBT4\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

My friends and I rode it and enjoyed it so I touched a few things up and have decided to release it now. It isn’t as quality as the tracks that are being released now but a lot of my time and others time helping me was spent so it is worth putting it up for download. A lot of the art and some of the 3d models were done by me which was time consuming but rewarding.\nThe track is loosely based on Crandon International — at lease that is the aerial I started out with. It was never meant to be a replica just a grungy feeling track that has been around forever. There are some things to explore including a short dirt oval track to use while waiting for races or for something different.\nCredits:\nHigh Line Designs\nMariusT\nResolute Kraken\ninsane\nTFC\nMouk Lab\ngiopanda\nPDR\nBOWTIE\nQuick Mick\nSpecial shoutout to MariusT , he helped me advance through Blender and tackle advanced problems that I never would have been able to make it through. Seriously, a lot of this map exists because of his time spent helping and explaining. I appreciate the help a lot.\nThanks to my Factory Rejects teammates for test riding and giving feedback.\nHope you enjoy,\nQuick Mick\nMore Picture:\nhttps://www.yogile.com/kie7s210hrx#21t\nP.S.

Worked some berms and braking bumps.\nUpdate 2: Actually fixed what I said was fixed in update 1. The first time, I extracted the heightmap to my desktop instead of the project folder, but this time I remembered how to use my brain.\nUpdate 3 (11/12/2021 @3:03pm ET): I promise this time, I got the files right. The Starting gate is fixed, berms are smoothed out, and other things are\noptimized\n. I deleted my track file and downloaded the new pkz to make sure it’s fixed, and I promise it is lol. I’m sorry about the constant updates for my own mess ups. Next time won’t be like this\nHey guys! This is my 3rd track build for MXB and I have again learned so much with this build process. I’m proud to present Tomahawk Mx from Hedgesville, WV. I was able to ride this track twice last year while I was living up in Maryland, and loved the layout, and thought that it would flow well in MX Bikes. I have put several agonizing hours into changing my mind between assets, textures, and so much more, and I am happy with the final product to give to you all. Unlike Sky Is The Limit, this is an actual race track with an actual centerline. I was able to squeeze 28 gates on the starting line along with 28 pits, so it can handle larger servers. This track is potato PC friendly. However, if it is running lousy, turn 3d grass off.\nDon’t forget to investigate what the hill people of West Virginia have been doing in the woods!!!\nI’d like to thank Resolute Kraken, TFC, AGMX, GioPanda, Rosshell, Mouklab, Fred Mx, RedRider197 and all the boys in the discord server whom I most likely annoyed with my stupid questions. I’d also like to give a shoutout to all my girlfriend, Amber for being patient when I would spend hours working on this track, and also for making the title in the thumbnail.\nDonations are NOT at all required, but if you enjoy my work, and would like to buy me some Reigns so I can crank out my next project, my cashapp is $dylan44frisch.

I’ve learned a lot during this track build that I didn’t know when I made Tampa (ie: deformation, shadows, etc.). I am super stoked about this one and can’t wait to play it with the community.\nA few points that I want to discuss:\nI realize that the centerline (lap times) don’t work. This was actually on purpose. Reason being is when I built this track, I wanted to create a place for friends to come and hit massive jumps and not worry about lap times or coming in first. Sometimes it is okay to not get sweaty, and instead just vibe.\nThis track does have some massive jumps, and some technical sections. I have put several laps down on a 250, and it will absolutely clear every jump, it is just not that easy. Once the track gets chewed up enough, clearing everything on a 450 even gets challenging.\nI am always open to suggestions and will update the track if need be.\nI’d like to thank Resolute Kraken, TFC, AGMX, GioPanda, Rosshell, Mouklab, and all the boys in the discord server whom I most likely annoyed with my stupid questions. I’d also like to give a shoutout to my girlfriend, Amber for being patient when I would spend hours working on this track, and also for making the title in the thumbnail.\nDonations are NOT at all required, but if you enjoy my work, and would like to buy me some Reigns so I can crank out my next project, my cashapp is $dylan44frisch.

I want to thanks Ponza,Niko Mouk, Goutsou and Tylaz for their help and the beta testing who helped me to stepped up my game and learning how to create a track . Enjoy,have fun riding it and feel free to leave a comment !\nBig thanks to Kris for creating this terrain back in 2017, he put in a lot of work that we’ve been able to adapt into MXB, but none of that would have been possible without his initial effort. This track is a credit to the amount of work he put into building this from scratch and we thank him for being a part of this build, as this track would not be what it is without his original creation.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 806\nDefault\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/AIMlGI5S#Kcwwk369EuYE-OhJmZytHOcvVJC5ftPpO-G3kL9XCW4\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\ninsane!\nAny support is greatly appreciated! ♥\nBuy me a beer!",

He was already making up names for the enormous jumps scattered across the track, like Mt. Barcia and the Dirty Drop. When the track was complete, Jason Baker (the proud builder) was asked his thoughts on the finished product. “I was so happy that Justin and his family gave me free reign on their property, and let me turn this relatively flat piece of land into a motocross haven! I feel when my creativity is not restricted – the sky is the limit!” – RacerXonline report, May 24, 2011. This track is based in MOTOBOSS MX Simulator layout, with his permission to bring it back in MX Bikes! Converted by Manoelntjp with help of SK1P for some 3D’s, Giopanda track assets and TFC/NikoMouk Tutorials. Thanks for everyone involved at development and beta testing, in special FireBl4ze for reporting bugs and issues. The proportion was done to match MX Bikes physics, many changes and ruts was done to use only MX1 layout. Still in beta, soon will be completed with MX2 layout and Supercross route.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1280\nDefault\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1y28QYHCfZMWrqLzsDiv9qE1Y_8ovvbNb/view?usp=sharing\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

My hope is that intermediate and pro players will have fun on it. It’s very fun once you get in a good rhythm with lots of different options around the whole track.\nNo fences has collision since this seemed to be a lot of people got stuck on MXGP of Russia.\nThe track comes with a standard HQ version, MQ version, LQ version and Ultra LQ version.\nHQ – The original.\nMQ – The original but deleted some “fluff” such as crowd, tearoffs, semi trailers, cars, tents, toitois, etc.\nLQ – All unnecessary objects to gameplay deleted, LQ object textures. Deleted SHAD prefix on objects.\nUltra LQ – Same as LQ but most objects do not have any textures/shaders. Deleted SHAD prefix on objects.\nThe track also comes with a Re-shade preset if you want to try.\nThanks to:\nRuubs for beta testing and help in general.\nResolute Kraken for track builder tool and some objects.\nGiopanda – ToiToi’s and live timer.\nAlot of hard work and hours went into this, I hope you enjoy it.\nIf you like my work, please consider making a\ndonation\n.\nJV\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 10926\nDefault\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CS7Y3ezqD-DTq1wPw7gD8RCVzbb6uS8-?usp=sharing\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/folder/9uxryxo1doo2t/JV_-_MXGP_of_The_Netherlands_2021\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

I will be updating it once I finish all the off track assets and what not but that could be very, very much longer as I work nights and its hard for me to get the time to really sit down and grind it out. Some may love it and some may hate it, it’s not your smooth forest track and it’s not a lierop track. I want to thank a few people for their work and their help with this along with the support they put out through the community.\nSo Thank you to:\nResolute Kraken for an amazing tool to use to build tracks and TFC for practically 5 hours worth of tutorials.\nGiopanda, Agitato, Niko, TFC, and Fred MX for the Assets.\nGin, Niko Mouk, JV, iNsane, TFC, Ruubs, Jesse Mulock and Jones for all the help and patience with me playing 20 questions.\nPiboso for actually understand what people want and having an open sourced game that the community can build upon.\nPtrick, Mount4inDr3w, Scotty, Owen, Sonni, Barber, and Gin for testing and giving feedback on how they felt about the track.

This is my first ever track build and has been a work in progress since January. It is a replica of Area 51 Mx, located in Batavia, NY. There is the main motocross track, the Dunlop night cross, as well as a free ride section that the Aliens from A51 dropped off. The layouts for the Dunlop night cross, as well as the main track were inspired by the IRL layouts used from 2013-2019. I used a mixture of my favorite sections to come up with this build. HUGE shout out to the Razzles126, DBlu752 and the rest of the Stateline HRC Honda team for the hours of testing and feed back to make this possible. I hope you all enjoy! Please leave feedback in the comments so I can continue to grow as a track builder.

It also features a live camera set closely replicated to the real angles.\nThe track comes with a standard version and LQ (low quality) version (deleted many objects, background objects and SHAD prefix, not as nice looking). If you have a slow PC I strongly recommend you use the LQ. Before going LQ, try first turning on vsync, as a second measure 3D grass and as a third measure you can lower screen resolution.\nThe track also comes with a Re-shade preset if you want to try.\nThanks to:\nResolute Kraken for track builder tool and general support.\nInsane, Ruubs and Niko Mouk for support in general.\nGiopanda – ToiToi’s.\nAlot of hard work and hours went into this, I hope you enjoy it.\nIf you like my work, please consider making a\ndonation\n.\nJV\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 6250\nDefault\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l5ABItNL12FaCYA5YECzUPGZwwGKbHWE?usp=sharing\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/folder/hi0o2s5po94pb/JV_-_MXGP_of_Russia_2021\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

As a Swede it felt like the right thing to do a replica of Uddevalla from a time when I personally feel the track was it’s best and most epic to spectate, with typical Uddevalla GP weather.\nThe track comes with a standard version and LQ (low quality) version (deleted many objects). If you have a slow PC I strongly recommend you use the LQ. If you still want to run the standard version you can turn off 3D grass and lower screen resolution for better performance.\nThe track also comes with a Re-shade preset if you want to try.\nI strongly recommend Vsync , it seems to do wonders for this track.\nBig thanks to:\nResolute Kraken – track builder tool and general support.\nNiko Mouk, Insane, Ruubs – discord support in general.\nHellmachine – beta testing and cooking up an epic release video.\nJimbo – beta testing.\nAlso thanks to the people who donated on my last track, it really means a lot! All the money was re-invested into future projects.\nAs always a lot of hard work and many hours went into this track.\nI hope you enjoy it.\nIf you like my work, please consider making a\ndonation\n.\nJV\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4021\nDefault\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZkKjLBYiS56v-1V-4TWt412D8WOQy3AN?usp=sharing\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/folder/gjhbc0sor34zz/Uddevalla\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

Enjoy 😀\nOriginal post:\nI’ve only found out about MX Bikes because of the Steam release and have been rushing through modding tutorials in order to work out how to create custom content.\nThis is the first map I’d like to share; ‘Tarpeian Springs’ is the result of an auto generated landscape (L3DT) and a random squiggly line which came together to form a natural terrain, single trail enduro loop.  There are a few obstacles and trees to negotiate, and a bit of custom scenery for character.  I think the track gets better after a few laps as the deformation makes it look better and starts to produce new lines.  It’s a bit over 4kms long and a lap is about 5:40- it’s a bit of a challenge to complete a lap without dropping the bike.  The replay TV cameras are in place as well.\nI don’t play online so I don’t know if that works- I suspect it does.  I’ve only given it 6 gates because that seemed about right to me, and it wasn’t really something I was focusing on.  That’s easy enough to change if I do an update, although at the moment I’m very keen to move on from this project so I can continue to work on the old YZ465, and others…\nProblems that I know about are that sometimes a ‘long reset’ will put you back at the first corner, and there’s a few floating trees and objects not sitting right.\nThis has been an exercise in learning how to do everything I needed to do to get a track into the game without worrying about doing it well, so I guess it’s a Beta…\nIt’s not Motocross but hopefully there’ll be a few guys out there that will enjoy this track!\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 4155\nDefault\nmega.nz\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/#!jmw1yKKA!uZnLIbQIOf8stsMOan923cWJ7S_2Xc_g4KnyqNLAYQw\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHere is my first track release for MX Bikes. It’s a replica of my home track in Linköping, Sweden. My goal for this project was to make the track as close to reality as possible and have the same look and feel I would get on an open practice night in the summer.\nI would describe the track as quite hard/technical but very fun and satisfying once you get the flow going. If you like to go wide open at all times and rail berms dragging the bars in the ground this is not a track for you.\nFor those who are running on a slower PC, I’d strongly recommend that you turn down screen resolution and perhaps also turn off 3D grass.\nBig thanks to:\nResolute Kraken – track builder tool and tutorials.\nTFC – tutorials and answering my questions in forum/discord.\nNiko Mouk – tutorials and being super responsive in the discord.\nRuubs – answering questions in the discord.\nInsane – answering questions in the discord.\nGiopanda – for a few of the objects from his objects pack.\nHellmachine – beta testing and cooking up an epic release video.\nA Lot of hard work went into this track to make it beautiful and optimized enough to be raceable for most people.\nI hope you enjoy it.\nIf you like my work, please consider making a\ndonation\n.\nJV\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 5661\nDefault\ndrive.google.com\nDownload from drive.google.com\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V9fScmO7iU4_b_KIPvlNdjJuliZ-q6p6?usp=sharing\nDefault\nmediafire.com\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/6xlbghvrwvqc4t6/Linköping.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

The track originally was just the outdoor national and 2 SX tracks, but in the process of converting the tracks to work with the physics of MX Bikes we decided to go wild with all of the extra space we had left on the map. We really wanted to push the limits of realistic track making with this one, we hope you all enjoy!\nThe track includes:\n1 outdoor national\n2 supercross tracks\n2 FMX areas (quarter pipe area and standard FMX arena)\n2 sand tracks (Crack Track 2.0 raceable)\nRiver gap jump\nBooter hills\nTurn track\nand 6 hidden easter eggs spread across the map\n—– PLEASE READ —–\nDISCALIMER FOR THOSE GETTING LOW FPS: Please turn off your 3D grass to improve performance, my fps dramatically improves when disabled on online races\nTECHNIQUE TO JUMPING THE QUARTER PIPES: Higher speeds work better with the steep ramp physics, getting the perfect turn down into the landing takes a little bit of practice bending the physics. The best way to describe jumping them is to lean back near the last second as your bike is exiting the takeoff, from there try to perform a turn down but it just comes with practice, or you can hit up Jason Pelster from Prospect Designs as he’s the Axell Hodges of the the ramps\nDonations are of course not required, but if you’d like to compensate my link is\npaypal.me/brethurren\nCome join my track creating streams!\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/hurrencanetv\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1280\ndefault\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/dgzq1cqwbca4j4b/Morin_Factory.zip/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

This course has more elevation than most of the Dutch enduro’s. That means that this course will test both the local heroes and the internationals.\nThe key to De Heuvelenberg is to keep cool, look ahead and don’t try to go too fast. There are a lot of trees and little rocks. They’re easy to run in to, be carefull! Be prepared to get tired, really tired.\n*Help! I have low framerates!\nBe sure to turn off 3D grass and perhaps lower your overall graphics when having a low framerate.\nYou could perhaps delete the forest1.wav file from the track folder as well. This file is the sounds you hear on track. It wouldn’t suprise me if that’d cause low framerates.\nPlease note:\nThis track started out as a test, so don’t expect much from it. The trackside cameras are bad, really bad. I added them, but didn’t spend much time on them. I also know some trees have flipped faces and some just have weird shadows. I don’t want to find the 10-20 out of 2000 trees that have issues. That’d take me years. I learned a lot doing this track. My next track should be better in all ways.\nDonations are always welcome):\npaypal.me/kuilder\nEdit by Ruubs\n!!!!

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nThis is the mxb-mods upload of the Beta 4 (time flies!) James Stewart (JS7) Compound replica TFC and I made back then. NOTHING CHANGED COMPARED TO FORUM RELEASE!\nComplete with a National Loop, SX South (Clay) and SX North (Sand). Additionally, a Free Practice version is included, allowing you to practice on whatever track you fancy.\nWe hope you will enjoy the track as much as we do – and as much as we enjoyed working on this project for the last two months together.\nA lot of time and effort has been spent to make it as rideable, enjoyable and realistic as possible, while keeping it fairly low on computer requirement (heightmap and masks are 2049). All layouts come with their set of marshals and cameras. If you run with deformation, it will add a bit of challenge but is largely manageable. Plus, it looks pretty cool due to the use of different texture layers.\nFree Practice Layout\nThe base track. It’s built using a combination of the National, SX South and SX North centerlines. Practicing and falling should allow you to reset properly as long as you were somewhere close to the actual tracks. A few weird resets are still possible but should be extremely rare. Couple of laps of National, bit of try-harding on the SX North… up to you!\nNational layout\nAs it says, the national loop. Intended for lap times and races. 40 bikes pit, 2×20 start gate\nTwo different SX tracks have been included in the compound. Please treat them as practice tracks to enjoy them even more. Fast lines do exist, but each track has a ton of different options to practice different skills every lap. Try a full lap using only the inside lines for example! No tough blocks on both tracks.\nSX South (Clay – Easy) ~ 50s laptime.\nThis is the easier of the two and should be considered as a stepping stone to SX. It is very forgiving, flows well, and does not require any special technique to complete fully. Based on the 2015 layout. 20 bikes pit, 2×10 start gate.\nSX North (Sand – Hard) ~ 1min laptime.\nThis one is the opposite. It is brutal and unforgiving, and should be attempted only when running lap cleanly on SX South can be considered easy if you want to avoid frustration. Throttle control, seat bouncing, break sliding, you’ll need it all to run fast laps. Based on the 2016 layout. 20 bikes pit, 2×10 start gate.\nThe compound\nThe scale is as close to 100% as was sensible. The dimensions are scaled up ever so slightly but were not talking much, and all in the interest of making it both a realistic replica and a fun track to ride.\nThis is the first track where TFC has made the objects in Blender and has managed to get trees with alpha working 99% – There are a couple of errors but they are barely noticeable. All objects are 100% original, made and textured by TFC and probably took about as long as the national track heightmap!\nWe have slaved over all aspects of this track, and it’s a real labor of love.\nThe Skydomes are borrowed from GP Bikes. We tried to reach out on the GPB forum to find out who made them but nobody came forward. Since they’re used on quite a few GPB tracks I assumed they are just available..\nThe screenshots you see below have no ‘background.edf’ in the folder. Personally I like to run this track without it, as the trees are already intended to provide enough background. Running the track without it allows you to take better screenshots from above the horizon point of view.\nSo from both of us, we hope you guys enjoy it! Looking forward to riding it online with you all.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 8409\ndefault\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/file/IBw1XTDJ#rtKWaoxrhqBQ2ZUsN19fSarHgnI4qULxdsRbLIslqhY\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nHigh Point MX 2019! The brief story behind this one is that GDUBMX sent me a version made by a few people back in the day to see if I could clean it up. I noticed the scale was slightly out so double checked it but didn’t realise just quite how far from 1:1 it was. I couldn’t fix, so I decided to make it from scratch. The layout is 2019 as it’s the latest I had to work from real footage.\nThis track features custom one off skydomes, specially made objects and for the first time a real location background (so the trees and hills you see around the map are from the real location).\nFeedback welcome! The rollers can be singled, doubled, and there is even a triple in there somewhere. I’ve tried to be a bit more liberal with the checkpoints so it’s not the end of the world if you go out a corner but you have to hit jump lines and rough sections for your lap to remain in tact. Thanks to GDUB for the initial reason I got to do this track (it’s one I wanted to do originally anyway but didn’t as one already existed), thanks to BEYER, Teeds and Ruben for testing.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nThis track is recreation of Hangtown 2018. (Created using the 125 All Star Race footage). Originally this project started out as a modification of the original “Hangtown” that was released in mid-July. I then realized to make the track as realistic as possible I would not only need to model the track completely, but also dedicate to a layout. Thus, Hangtown 2018 was created.\nThis track contains several deviations from the earlier “Hangtown,” most notably there are two additional sections. Included are the switchback section after the peak jump, and the wall and step-up before the “Fly 150.” However, there is a single deviation from the 2018 layout. In the 2018 race, the “Fly 150” (the large uphill triple) is a set of whoops. Upon discussion with Hangtown locals I decided to replace the whoop section with the “Fly 150” becuase, “we try to forget the year they replaced that…”. While it would be unique to have the whoop section in place, I decided to keep the 150 to create the “ideal” track in my mind.\nI big thank you to Mulock22 – He has been the man through the creation of this track. He has provided wonderful feedback and created the fully-functional camera set to accompany the track.\nHope you all enjoy.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 1446\ndefault\nDownload from mediafire.com\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/mpki6xhdnwv7snb/Hangtown_2018.pkz/file\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.",

It has a detailed heat map for the deformation, so the more laps you put in the better the track gets, as the breaking bumps start to change lines and add some speed! I plan to drop 4-5 more tracks in the next few weeks. Some crazy like Reflex, some more realistic and focused on ruts, berms, and so on. I hope y’all have fun, lmk what you think!\nBig thanks to everyone for the help, for the assets, and for everything!

The version I released for the GTX series as beta is almost a different track. Some elements are the same, but the majority of it has been completely remade as I wasn’t happy with a lot of it. To the eye, the hieghtmap might look quite similar to the beta, but if you were to ride the old version in MXB B6, you would be disappointed.\nI’ve tried to be as authentic as possible with heightmap, object placement, and have tried to include the key features of the track that make it Red Bud (stands, sign, buildings, tunnels, flag etc..). All objects here are 100% made by myself, bespoke to this map so to speak, bar the trees. The trees are from a texture pack of 3d rendered images. Also kinda cool, if you run a clean lap in testing watch the replay back and compare it to the 2016 450 main (which I based the cameras on) and you’ll see that the jumps are 99% accurate as far as size and how high / far the bikes travel.\nI’ve spent a LOT of time on the deformation. Red Bud is loamy (apparently) lots of sandy loose soil with compact sections. While the track rides great as standard, I think it rides even better when massively deformed. It’s a challenge, but some areas become easier – Corners for example. Lots of the inside ruts are just suggestions before they’ve been deformed. If you stick to these suggestions they become amazingly grippy, to the point you can slide into one and be caught half way into a corner as you can see in the video below.\nAlso 2 new skies included here. Feel free to use them elsewhere, I will add them to the assets thread when I get time along with a few track objects which I’ve made here for people to use elsewhere\nI’m really proud of this track, more so than everything else I’ve made with exception to Matterley Basin and the JS7 compound. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I’ve enjoyed making it and riding it. See you all online to rip it up soon!\nOh, and if you like my tracks, appreciate the effort I put in and want to say thanks, you can always\nbuy me a drink\n, but please note your thanks in a forum post is more than enough. I do this for love, not money, I’ve just had quite a few requests to include a donate button so figured I would for my next release (this one).\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 510\ndefault\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/#!cxMUSILC!MrTe-wDx_JuKGFmmrESiXqFIMp0Kt_GWiPI-g_Z6Zms\nMod Instructions\n(DEFAULT)\nPut the PKZ file or folder into your \"mods/tracks/*category*\" folder.\nSupport\ninsane!\nAny support is greatly appreciated! ♥\nBuy me a beer!",

It’s about as accurate as it gets without getting too obsessed about the off track areas.\nIn the interest of time, which I don’t have too much of these days, I’ve really not put too much effort into the objects on this track. The off track is pretty basic, the pit area is plain with no tents and I’ve only modelled the main buildings. This doesn’t take away from the experience at all though in my opinion, and I just wanted to get the track released instead of spending ages perfecting something that doesn’t add to the ride.\nCouple of cool things are the lake and the windows, as I learnt how to add the reflection shader with a custom environment map to track objects, and of course the track normal map which kind of mimics an off season dry /  slightly ridden surface. The deformation get’s hectic here.\nEnjoy!\nUpdated version 23rd November 2017. Removed normal layer on top and added pitboards.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 265\ndefault\nDownload from 1drv.ms\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!AmFynRoK33UNg_oiu2NH6cZjpB3K8w\nSupport\ninsane!\nAny support is greatly appreciated! ♥\nBuy me a beer!",

The fun for me is how fast you can go once you learn where to scrub, where to seat bounce and stay low, you can really improve laptimes this way here.\nGoogle Earth was kind enough to have all the jumps from the 2015 layout in 3d, so making a replica was incredibly easy and quick using Google Earth as a reference to build in L3DT. I can guarantee that this is 100% 1:1 scale, making it all the more fun to ride. The track is generally pretty easy with three do-or-die sections.

      "description": "Description\nDownloads\nIt’s been a long time since I did a track. Well, found a good opportunity… in a form of a nice 3D scan of a motocross track in Slovenia, Trbovlje MX. The initial track scan was made by mobilexcopter using a QT0x4 and released on\nSketchfab\n(don’t waste your time looking it’s the only one there). I ported it into MXB and polished it a bit. Here is how it looks, side to side with a GoPro of the track (in winter, with a slightly different layout): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23DYZLTa21o\nThe track rides well, it’s an old school style local MX track.\nIt’s a 1:1 scaling in all directions!\nNo huge jumps, but some nasty elevation changes. Some very fast sections, some very slow sections. Overall, it’s “medium rough” – ruts are there, it shakes you up a bit, some braking bumps, and some chewed up faces but nothing that will make you randomly fall. It is however a bit more difficult than most track we usually see. Textures are from the scan pictures – you ride on what you see!\nFirst 3D scanned map in MXBikes and have to say it has turned out above my expectations. Have fun!\nDOWNLOAD LINK ON MEGA\nCredits:\nmobilexcopter on Sketchfab for the 3D scan\nTFC for the SkyBoxes and advice\nSandbiter for the Trees\nFabian van Dorst on Sketchfab for the tyres\n… and last but not least Snappe for helping me sort out scaling (still no idea what’s going on in Blender though).\nFor the curious:\nThe scan was a 3D object that I turned into an 8k heightmap to work on.\n95%+ of the on track heightmap is untouched. I just corrected a few holes and trees here and there.\nHad to basically redo the off track from scratch (fuck trees).\nOnce all heightmap work was done: Gaussian Filter 2 pixel wide (removing noise and the “pebbles” from the track), scaling down to 2k. Any less filtering and it was unridable due to random kicks, and any higher resolution and the FPS was all over the place.\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 377\ndefault\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/#!BVYR0YQI!A08NrwfEzFaZ6MxT0UdANG3hSAmZ57yETP0a7EfdqqU",

Try starting with a single, double or try the triple in!\n[*]Terrain textures have shadow maps on them.\n[*][b]There are 2 tracks in the download. The normal one -regular name- has [u]collision enabled on toughblocks[/u][/b]. This is more realistic, and I worked a lot on centerline placement in combination with toughblocks placement so that, in 1h of normal play, I did not get one single cross-lane reset. It is the one intended for online racing. If you try goon enough and cross jump, sure you will manage… but then, introducing the [b]GRE, or “GoonRidingEdition(tm)”[/b], does not have any collision and is intended for getting you up to racing speed for online play.\n[*]Terrain should now provide slightly better grip and feel more controlable.[/list]\nI was aiming at an easier to access but harder to master track than the first one. Overall, it has more spots where you can make the difference – and this time, the difference will be made on getting your lines and rythm down rather than trying to charge one single corner exit, as every obstacle is easily doable. Just find a way to make them flow together. It is much more technical than the first track as it requires a great jumping technique to do a full lap using the “real” lines (angled jumps, cutting on take-off, seat bouncing…). It is however much easier to cruise around at medium speed and feel satisfied. On a 250F, you need to push it hard to get good laps down. The 450F has more line choices and relies more on throttle control.\nI tried invisible walls, but it just felt wrong. The duo-track solution is imo a good compromise. And I know the shape of the “gate table” is shitty to ride on, but look at the footage from the event, it was even worse 😉\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 55\ndefault\nDownload from 1drv.ms\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!AmFynRoK33UNg-x7Zr48JoEZoL72uw",

It is based on the actual track that was raced, not the blueprint (there were a few changes). The goal was to have a fun but difficult and challenging track – from what I heard, this much is successful.\nIt is made to be raceable, even with collisions on. Each lane and turn has at least 2 different and viable lines. I strongly recommend a 250F as the 450F power delivery at low speed is really tough to handle. Throttle control galore!

I wanted to push the limits of what I was capable of doing in terms of SX, and what the game could take in its beta 4 stage.

But… [i]can YOU do it?[/i]\nI tried replicating the actual track and blueprint as well as possible, while making a fun track with a lot of options. Not the one lined hell that was raced (take a look at [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPlRTpZb4nU] this go pro of the event[/url] if you want to know what hell is like). I improvised in the turn after the finish line to keep it interesting and fun.

Being smooth and in control will be more rewarding than charging WFO like a madman\n[*]”introduced” the double wheel tap as a way to go over certain obstacles\n[*]some sections can only be done with proper body movement.

This will most likely be my last one until beta 5 comes out, as I will not be able (nor really willing) to devote the time it takes to make this kind of difficult track ridable and somewhat enjoyable in the near future.
