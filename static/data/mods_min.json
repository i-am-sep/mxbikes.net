I wanted to push the limits of what I was capable of doing in terms of SX, and what the game could take in its beta 4 stage. [b]Overall, it is easier to be average this round, similarly difficult to previous rounds to be fast, but there are some wicked hard and fast lines.[/b] If you \u201csee\u201d a section, it is probably doable. But\u2026 [i]can YOU do it?[/i]\nI tried replicating the actual track and blueprint as well as possible, while making a fun track with a lot of options. Not the one lined hell that was raced (take a look at [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPlRTpZb4nU] this go pro of the event[/url] if you want to know what hell is like). I improvised in the turn after the finish line to keep it interesting and fun. And yes, beside the quad over the table, all his lines are doable.\nCompared to previous rounds:\n[list][*] jump faces and landings are very slightly steeper\n[*]whoops should be more forgiving, with a bigger range of minimal to maximal speed\n[*]rythm section start earlier exiting turns, finish later coming into turns. Being smooth and in control will be more rewarding than charging WFO like a madman\n[*]\u201dintroduced\u201d the double wheel tap as a way to go over certain obstacles\n[*]some sections can only be done with proper body movement. Yes, I went there.[/list]\n[b][size=4][url=https://mega.nz/#!NIoxHazS!4oqHJe0tUSZPuv7Cl1okKt7RFlfloFeWSGOceXEMzpM]Download SX2016RD03 on MEGA.NZ[/url][/size][/b]\n[b][size=4][url=http://www.mxb-central.com/sx2016-rd03-anaheim-2/]Download SX2016RD03 on MXB CENTRAL[/url][/size][/b]\nI hope you guys will enjoy this track! This will most likely be my last one until beta 5 comes out, as I will not be able (nor really willing) to devote the time it takes to make this kind of difficult track ridable and somewhat enjoyable in the near future. It just takes too much time messing around with the obstacles because the rider/bike cannot compensate a bit of spacing/shaping imperfections.\nHoh and yeah, feedback welcome \ud83d\ude09\nDownloads\nTotal downloads: 33\ndefault\nDownload from mega.nz\nhttps://mega.nz/#!NIoxHazS!4oqHJe0tUSZPuv7Cl1okKt7RFlfloFeWSGOceXEMzpM",

If you are interested in joining this series please message me and I will send you the discord for the series! Keep in mind, I\u2019m still a new track builder, so if you have any tips or tricks that could help me out, I\u2019m all ears!

Also the longer sand section through a whoop section. This track is ridable for all skill levels but is best for beginner and intermediate SX riders. Gate and pits for 22 riders.\nBig shoutout to RedRider for all the track and pit objects. As well as all his tips that have helped me along the way.\nAlso a big shoutout to Lynds for his video series that got me into track building to begin with.\nYes the PKZ will not match the name of the track.
